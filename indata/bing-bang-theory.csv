Sheldon And now you show up with my favorite shape of food A circle made of triangles served in a square box gasp OMG Sheldon How could you make such an elementary blunder Despite what the common person thinks pizzas are not cut into triangles A triangle is an area enclosed by three straight line segments Since a pizza is circular the outer edge of each slice is an arc not a line segment An area enclosed by two radii of a circle and the arc between them is called a sector A pizza is a circular food made up of sectors served in a square box Which since squares are two dimensional shapes and pizza boxes being three dimensional is actually a rectangular cuboid	2018-11-24T21:17:29.000Z	Comment	9qcVqp2PRQ8	The Big Bang Theory- Hilarious moments - Season 11

Every time I see the bits of Howard and the others scamming Sheldon Sheldon reminds me of Trump Trump was a really bad student In the second grade he socked his teacher in the stomach He s still so proud of it that he made Tony Schwartz keep that fact in the book Tony was writing called The Art of the Deal And it s some story how he came to write it He loathed Trump and had written an scathing article about him Trump is a believer of any press is good press And Tony needed money so he lied and told the world that Trump was a good businessman when he wasn t In the months he was in Trump s apartment he never saw ONE book Trump s close to illiterate But Trump will not admit when he s wrong Tony says he put lipstick on a pig Instead of the Bible Trump wanted to use The Art of the Deal He worships five things Himself money power sex and people cheering for him He s addicted to rallies We pay for him to go to rallies he just makes up And we pay for the staffers in the White House to go along with him That s why that intern knew it would be something Trump would want when she tried to take the mic away from Acosta I believe we ll find out Trump got Putin to rig the election Neither of those men know what honor is Trump like Hitler was a draft dodger And Hitler got in by murdering and lying Trump got in by cheating And even IF he didn t know when it was proven that Putin hacked states elections If he were an honorable man he would have stepped down But like how they cheated to get Whitaker in Trump didn t give up the job he didn t deserve to have Had it been any other job in the world he would have been fired He should have been Putin hates America and he s know Trump for years He knows everything about Trump and that he s a moron and a bully And because Putin is blackmailing him Trump is now a brown noser Did you see that smile he gave Putin Putin and Russian journalist call him the useful idiot Sheldon just couldn t stand that Howard beat him at anything He s like Trump believing he knows everything and he s always looked down on all of them Of course he s not invented ANYTHING where as Howard has He just can t stand that Howard who is a brilliant engineer and has a Masters beat him at anything so HE cheats He lies and lies to make them believe he knows how to do the same trick Then he uses his temper mind your own business No one likes someone with a temper but Sheldon resorted to that He was THAT desperate to win but worst of all he thinks they are SO stupid that he can fool anyone and he resents them for exposing his cheating Just like Trump does ALL the time And now he s down to name calling Like a child he s calling heros and other decent people all kinds of names Spoiled rotten child whose never grown up I feel sorry for the Secret Service that they are forced to protect a traitor like Trump I wonder how many of them have quit rather than works guarding Trump Guarding a child who averages lies a day and has insulted so many of our allies Songs	2018-11-24T22:03:55.000Z	Comment	tplHcZlgDyk	The Big Bang Theory   Best Hilarious Moments of Season 4

My Faustian Dilemma In my opinion quality studying can get heavy and dark much like belonging to a secret society You may feel powerful for a while as you begin to understand the world It can be very Faustian as you understand the historical events and people used to attempt to sell their souls for this kind of modern information This is true especially in certain areas like Math English Metalworking as it leads to chemistry and engineering the Occults and certain Histories or Physics as it deals with energy and motion What is a better way to express or resolve this than with music or high refined similes and metaphors Sure I think some won t admit to their understandings and eliminate some of their expressions to make them more palatable A lot of artists are very specific in their complex metaphors Is this dangerous Sure It s like trying to spot Icarus and naming him Jesus Early handshakes and official posts are always in discrepancy after not having investment cash or quality attire and looks but I don t think that everyone is stupid Sure I have seen lesser Copernicus diagrams riddled with alchemical attempts and angels and devils of their period They re usually called the Occults Yes there can be battle expressions as it can contribute to prowess in volleys swordsmanship or Maritime understandings Why not Misguided GIS and gravity waves with packets definitely exist Are their spiritual packets with living matter and a Bermuda Triangle I don t know about the Pythagorean bean souls and transmigration though Hilarious Confusion is Sex ual Wars of the Devil are wars of information Are you under a need for peace A person has to be very selective about the books they buy and the study techniques they use because either way it s going to hurt Bad psychology will make you ugly as will restaurant food on and on The Devils appreciated their psychology and vanity yes One s sexual balance and lack of need are rooted in those understandings also A healthy mind promotes a healthy body right I m and expect few future walls of information to break down	2018-11-30T10:58:53.000Z	Comment	xNmcdhUmNwA	The Big Bang Theory - Sheldon's Breakdown (S12E09)

The original actress who portrayed Amy s mom isn t dead her name is Annie O Donnell This is the answer in regards to recasting her by TBBT producer Steve Holland When we met Amy s mother in Season as played by actress Annie O Donnell it was before Amy had become such a big part of the show It was a one off scene on Skype Annie did a wonderful job But when we had the chance to bring the character back in a role that could possibly recur we decided to make a change And series co creator Chuck Lorre had a relationship with Kathy Bates after they worked together on Netflix s Disjointed and well how do you say no to bringing Kathy Bates on Laughs	2018-11-26T09:13:55.000Z	Comment	sm_NdpCrhcQ	The Big Bang Theory - Sheldon Bonds With Amy's Mother (S12E08)

So if you marry someone you by default have to make kids That s quite hypocritical I thought marriage was for choosing a partner you love and want to spend your whole life with no matter what happens and not a chosen womb to incubate your sperm a sperm donnor who gets unwanted responsibility otherwise we d be picking ppl by simply genes to get healthy kids penny ain t in the wrong she just haven t thought before about this subject Leonard ofc would want kids man have it easy not having to wreck their bodies carrying a parasite inside for months which eventually bursts out of your genitals and afterwards is stuck with you for years call modern ppl selfish but the planet is already overpopulated and some ppl choose not to bring kids into the word ain t nothing wrong with that it s not like back in the days where women didn t have any choice in the matter so many ppl get abortions anyways so what s wrong with choosing to abstain from the start	2018-11-22T22:01:47.000Z	Comment	swze_BjrCE4	The Big Bang Theory - Are You Pregnant?!

Personally I never cared for Sheldon Cooper or Jim Parsons for that matter I suggest they simply kill him off in an episode where he s robbed or something and continue the show Amy can get remarried and the show can go on It s a pity when a LibTard such as Jim Parsons can be so arrogant to walk away from the show and only doing it because of his ego Screw you Sheldon you were the worst character on the show anyways I found a few of Penny s Ex Boyfriends far more useful for the show then Sheldon EVER WAS This is MY OPINION and I m sticking to it Cheers	2018-11-24T01:32:37.000Z	Comment	nMdEtQgA2fw	The Real Reason Why The Big Bang Theory Is Ending

If Howard did get it on with Penny then do you think he fucked her with his nose Most jews have gargantuan noses that would give Pinnochio an inferiority complex I m also assuming that with a circumcised dick a jews nose would definitely be bigger than his dick too Penny on the other hand is such a whore that I m pretty sure she s been nose fucked fist fucked and even foot fucked There s probably not a lot that hasn t been up her cunt and I m not talking about the entire population of Omaha and Pasadena either	2018-12-05T16:42:29.000Z	Comment	TQzzyq5-8wg	"""Howard all flirting with penny"" The big bang theory | Part 2"

Sheldon is such a f ing idiot and a dimwitted son of a bitch when it comes to games like this or anything related to it It s all his fault that he and Leonard lost every game Because he always has so much science logic and high thinking in his head that he cannot even think about anything that is related to stuff regarding low intelligence It s also his fault because he s completely anti social who is quite social and knows stuff like it And he also tends to blame everybody for what he does wrong and he says that nothing is ever his fault He s a c t and a piece of shit I m SO glad Leonard doesn t live with him anymore It would ve been better if it was Leonard and Penny versus Sheldon and Amy because then the former couple would win	2018-11-20T03:21:13.000Z	Comment	C8lMW0MODFs	Game Night - Pictionary (Guys vs Girls) ~ The Big Bang Theory ~
