Chorus I m not afraid I m not afraid To take a stand To take a stand Everybody Everybody Come take my hand Come take my hand We ll walk this road together through the storm Whatever weather cold or warm Just lettin you know that you re not alone Holla if you feel like you ve been down the same road Intro Yeah it s been a ride I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one Now some of you might still be in that place If you re tryin to get out just follow me I ll get you there Verse You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay em But you won t take the sting out these words before I say em Cause ain t no way I ma let you stop me from causin mayhem When I say I ma do somethin I do it I don t give a damn what you think I m doin this for me So fuck the world feed it beans It s gassed up if it thinks it s stoppin me I ma be what I set out to be without a doubt undoubtably And all those who look down on me I m tearin down your balcony No ifs ands or buts don t try to ask him why or how can he From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he s still shittin Whether he s on salary paid hourly Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him Whichever comes first for better or worse He s married to the game like a fuck you for Christmas His gift is a curse Forget the Earth he s got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt And fuck the whole universe Chorus I m not afraid I m not afraid To take a stand To take a stand Everybody Everybody Come take my hand Come take my hand We ll walk this road together through the storm Whatever weather cold or warm Just lettin you know that you re not alone Holla if you feel like you ve been down the same road Verse Okay quit playin with the scissors and shit and cut the crap I shouldn t have to rhyme these words in a rhythm For you to know it s a rap You said you was king you lied through your teeth For that fuck your feelings Instead of gettin crowned you re gettin capped And to the fans I ll never let you down again I m back I promise to never go back on that promise In fact let s be honest that last Relapse CD was ehh Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground Relax I ain t goin back to that now All I m tryin to say is get back click clack blaow Cause I ain t playin around There s a game called circle and I don t know how I m way too up to back down But I think I m still tryin to figure this crap out Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn t This fuckin black cloud still follows me around But it s time to exorcise these demons These muh fuckers are doin jumpin jacks now Chorus I m not afraid I m not afraid To take a stand To take a stand Everybody Everybody Come take my hand Come take my hand We ll walk this road together through the storm Whatever weather cold or warm Just lettin you know that you re not alone Holla if you feel like you ve been down the same road Bridge And I just can t keep livin this way So startin today I m breakin out of this cage I m standin up I ma face my demons I m mannin up I ma hold my ground I ve had enough now I m so fed up Time to put my life back together right now Verse It was my decision to get clean I did it for me Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you So I could come back a brand new me You helped see me through And don t even realize what you did believe me you I ve been through the wringer But they can do little to the middle finger I think I got a tear in my eye I feel like the king of My world haters can make like bees with no stingers And drop dead no more beef lingers No more drama from now on I promise To focus solely on handlin my responsibilities as a father So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters And raise it you couldn t lift a single shingle on it Cause the way I feel I m strong enough to go to the club Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up Cause I m raisin the bar I d shoot for the moon but I m too busy gazin at stars I feel amazin and I m Chorus I m not afraid I m not afraid To take a stand To take a stand Everybody Everybody Come take my hand Come take my hand We ll walk this road together through the storm Whatever weather cold or warm Just lettin you know that you re not alone Holla if you feel like you ve been down the same road	2018-11-10T16:03:59.000Z	Comment	bVo-5dh64QU

I m not afraid I m not afraid yeah To take a stand it s been a ride Everybody I guess I had to Go to that place To get to this one Now some of you Might still be in that place If you re tryin to get out Just follow me I ll get you there You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay em But you won t take the sting out these words before I say em Cause ain t no way I m a let you stop me from causin mayhem When I say I m a do somethin I do it I don t give a damn what you think I m doin this for me so fuck the world feed it beans It s gassed up if it thinks it s stoppin me I mma be what I set out to be without a doubt undoubtedly And all those who look down on me I m tearin down your balcony No if ands or buts don t try to ask him why or how can he From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he s still shittin Whether he s on salary paid hourly until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him Whichever comes first for better or worse He s married to the game like a fuck you for Christmas His gift is a curse forget the Earth he s got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt And fuck the whole universe I m not afraid I m not afraid To take a stand to take a stand Everybody everybody Come take my hand come come take my hand We ll walk this road together through the storm Whatever weather cold or warm Just letting you know that you re not alone Holla if you feel like you ve been down the same road Okay quit playin with the scissors and shit and cut the crap I shouldn t have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it s a rap You said you was king You lied through your teeth for that fuck your feelings Instead of gettin crowned you re gettin capped and to the fans I ll never let you down again I m back I promise to never go back on that promise In fact let s be honest that last Relapse CD was eh Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground Relax I ain t goin back to that now All I m tryin to say is get back click clack blow cause I ain t playin around It s a game called circle and I don t know how I m way too up to back down But I think I m still tryin to figure this crap out Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn t this fuckin black cloud Still follows me around but it s time to exercise these demons These muh fuckers are doin jumpin jacks now I m not afraid I m not afraid To take a stand to take a stand Everybody everybody Come take my hand come come take my hand We ll walk this road together through the storm Whatever weather cold or warm Just letting you know that you re not alone Holla if you feel like you ve been down the same road And I just can t keep living this way So starting today I m breaking out of this cage I m standing up I mma face my demons I m manning up I mma hold my ground I ve had enough now I m so fed up Time to put my life back together right now now It was my decision to get clean I did it for me Admittedly I probably did it subliminally For you so I could come back a brand new me you helped see me through And don t realize what you did believe me you I been through the ringer but they could do little to the middle finger I think I got a tear in my eye I feel like the king of My world haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead No more bee flingers no more drama from now on I promise to focus solely on handlin my responsibilities as a father So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it You couldn t lift a single shingle on it cause the way I feel I m strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub And lift the whole liquor counter up cause I m raising the bar I d shoot for the moon but I m too busy gazin at stars I feel amazing and I m not I m not afraid I m not afraid To take a stand to take a stand Everybody Everybody Come take my hand come Come take my hand We ll walk this road together through the storm Whatever weather cold or warm Just letting you know that you re not alone Holla if you feel like you ve been down the same road	2018-09-14T12:34:25.000Z	Comment	uuiqhqHgB-A

Leonardo Frenquelli Allora io rispetto il tuo punto di vista perch tuo parere personale Ma solo una cosa gi pac e molto bravo e sono d accordo con te per non mi puoi venire a dire che not afraid una canzone di merda perch semplicemente non lo Trasmette delle vere emozioni Poi un altra cosa vorrei farti capire che una persona nel corso dei anni cambia come giusto che sia per ogni essere umano e quindi anche il lavoro che fa in conseguenza cambia Ps senza offesa per non penso che tu sia molto legittimo di cittare certi canzoni in quanto non ne sai neanche la calligrafia esatta	2018-06-07T20:30:03.000Z	Reply	Gv1ViCuH-K0
la tua risposta se giusta solo fino a un certo punto vero lui parla anche delle cose che hai citato ma col passare degli anni e con il fatto di aver rischiato di morire e esserci andato molto vicino comunque a anche cambiato un po i significati poi non capisco cosa ci trovi di senza senso vero una canzone sentita da davvero tantissimi dodicenni che di rap non ne sanno un cazzo soprattutto dove vivo io comunque questo non toglie il fatto che questa canzone abbia un grande significato te lo posso testimoniare che grazie a questa canzone e molte altre di eminem ma soprattutto questa e lose youself ed i loro testi mi hanno aiutato a guarire dalla depressione	2017-11-28T21:31:56.000Z	Reply	Gv1ViCuH-K0

Wilder the Mother Goose surrounds himself with butt kissers They told him he will easily beat Fury He has been out for too long and is too heavy But they didn t look at Tysons record His long stretches between fights Him gaining hundred plus lbs then losing it for the next fight Now Mr I want to be pregnant Wilder realizes this is not a journeyman type of fight and fury is in it for real wanting to get that last belt Will we see another Ali vs Foreman fight where Fury KOs Mrs Wilder out in the th round	2018-12-01T16:18:16.000Z	Comment	yn7M1GVwWVE

This is gonna be some sort of set up let Fury win this one so he gets his fairy tale ending and then get the remach going so Wilder gets his belt back and misses AJ in April It s the wbc I wouldn t be surprised	2018-12-01T06:52:24.000Z	Comment	yn7M1GVwWVE

Fear is the biggest enemy if you go into something fearing you ll lose there s a good chance you will you defeat yourself if you go into something accepting you could lose then you have freed your mind of course he s aware fury could win he sees fury as a good fighter but he s confident that he will beat fury nothing weird about it he sees to prove he s the best he has to fight the best	2018-11-30T18:26:44.000Z	Comment	yn7M1GVwWVE

I don t think he consciously realizes himself but a part of him senses that he could very well lose this fight So he couldn t help but mention it He s not looking for excuses he doesnt plan these things If you ve noticed whenever wilder reveals a weakness it s by accident It just slips out while he s blabbering And I feel like he s done it again He spoke for too long and exposed too much He shouldn t speak too much keep it to three intense sentences	2018-11-30T15:42:15.000Z	Comment	yn7M1GVwWVE
