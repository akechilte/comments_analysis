Looks like a Fan edit made by someone who can use After Effects but doesn t quite match the HBO level I mean it has basic quote from the series as the outline selected clips for each main character music audio clip from the previous season finale game of thrones font and HBO outro clip you could get from any of the previously released promotional videos	2018-11-30T15:16:09.000Z	Comment	CnhFBlkzYe8

great video but this is exactly why i am anti dany targaryen winnning in the end we need new heirs on the throne i fear the ending of game of thrones will be tragic and it will be all of dany fault she coming back to kings landing to reclaim her right to the throne but to me after how awful targaryens are when they are king the last targaryen king should have been her father the mad king and dany is showing signs of madness as well and when she come to kings landing history will repeat itself she will burn kings landing to the ground and kill civilains and the ones left will be devastated i want a new ending to game of thrones i want dany and jon to die i want sansa and tyrion to rule as new monarchs i want all magic gone and i want at least one member of each founding family to be left after all of this except targaryens i want arya bran and sansa to survive i want tyrion and jaimie to survive i want brienne and the hound to survive and i want sam and gilly and their son to survive and write a book about his best friend and i want a grey joy to survive and i want a baratheon gendry to survive	2018-11-30T11:25:52.000Z	Comment	baftcmxa1sw

it sounds like we wont get more about the story of the night king and the others the gods eye or any of this it sounds like just having a pointless battle without understanding why its just too shallow and doesnt represent what GRRM wrote im a big fan but if they dont explain it and go deeper into the story that would be frustrating	2018-11-24T15:53:31.000Z	Comment	bg2feQN7PRk

Lisab Sau As for Sansa I m not too sure how far she will go next season When Sansa said to Arya the lone wolf dies and the pack survives There was a noticeable gap in final shot of them looking over winterfell If Arya and Sansa had resolved there issues they would of been standing right next to each other instead they were apart	2018-11-06T12:50:59.000Z	Reply	bg2feQN7PRk

The children created both sides That s the twist Because of the destruction of the Valyrians the doom robert s rebellion Summerhall dance of dragons the ice and fire paradigm is out of control which is why the WW are leaving golden ratio spirals and balance symbolism There are two wheels which are going to be broken The kingdoms AND fire and ice Jon is going to be turned He s the song of fire and ice and will replace the NK but because of his blood it will fuck up the pact Ice will become Ice and fire with no opposite I think the Valyrians were created out of the last hero and chums The children wouldn t stop the WW because humans would still be a threat and grow out of control They therefore implemented a balancing act I also think after the long night these firewights left westeros went to the flames and set up the Valyrian freehold Valyrians are just the Fire version of white walkers Like Jon when he was resurrected I also think all characters who were resurrected in the show Berrick Cat and Jon all have blood of those first firewights Danny will die in childbirth leaving the child which will be both Ice and Fire	2018-11-28T15:56:10.000Z	Comment	J6lLP00MEnM

The level of inbreeding and madness among the Targaryen dynasty has been grossly overstated by fandom and especially by the TV show Their detailed family tree in TWOIAF struck me by how LITTLE inbreeding and madness actualy occurred relative to what everyone thinks Interestingly Daenerys s parents the mad King Aerys II and his sister wife Queen Rhaella were themselves the st in the family born of an incestuous union in over years or thereabouts I have always thought that the madness situation has less to do with genetics and more to do with the extremely potent and perilous power of the Dragonlord lineage to which the Targaryens belong It seems that when madness occurs the afflicted person quite literally takes on the most terrifying characteristics of a dragon with an obsession with power violence and fire And even more fascinating those who do go mad are almost all male not female	2018-11-28T07:21:54.000Z	Comment	smhDMdCZPc4
I love how enthusiastic you are Dany will sentence Jamie to death and that is when Tyrion will betray her and set up a meeting with Cersei and Jon to save his family I think Dany will simply hear about a Jon and Cersei meeting FROM VARYS and that will set her off She will burn Tyrion and go to KL and burn everything else Her fate as a crazy Targ is sealed I seriously do not think she is fit to rule Kingdoms especially without Tyrion She has no experience and she is just a warrior If she were rational she would have stayed in Dragonstone and just created more Dragons The Greyjoys will end up shooting her down And she will crash in the ocean and die Or Jon jumps on a Dragon and he has to kill her to stop her Jon sees people burning and dying and has to make a choice Making Jon do what Jamie did Break an oath and kill a Queen This will leave Dragon alive for Jon to ride and battle the Night King I think the Night King is a Targ Greenseer And Dragons eggs being stolen and given them to a Targ Female woke them TOO much Fire Not enough Ice The wars are over Later Jamie Impressed with Jon Knows what he has to do He goes to Cersei and with no warning chokes her to death Jamie pounces like a lion His violent acts are always unexpected ALWAYS and without warning He goes down in History as King Jamie The Golden Hand of Justice He marries Brianne and will father amazing blonde babies named Lannister He never got Ned s respect But he gets Jon s King Jon Whitewolf STARK King of the North Sansa Lady of the Vale Arya of the Twins Tulleys of Riverrun Gendry of the Stormlands Samwell Lord of the Reach Bron gets his focken Castle Casterly Rock	2018-11-28T02:23:37.000Z	Comment	smhDMdCZPc4

I m sorry I just feel like there is no way Dany will die at the end of Thrones She still needs to give birth to a whole baby lol And I don t want to believe GRRM would literally spend years of building Jon and Dany s characters up with parallels that mirrored each other as if they were two of the same only to kill off one or the other tragically Their union I believe will bring peace and harmony in the new generation of Westeros uniting both the magic of the Starks and Targaryens so there will be an even balance of magic within the world I picked up on Qyburn telling Pycelle just before he got killed at the end of s TWOW And sometimes before we can usher in the new the old must be put to rest	2018-11-28T00:20:12.000Z	Comment	smhDMdCZPc4

I completely agree that we may be wrong in hating the forthethrone marketing campaign GRRM has said that his favorite part of the LOTR books is the melancholy end the scourge of the Shire It s not an apocalypse ending it s a political hobbit vs hobbit struggle for control of their land ending Feels almost anticlimactic which is what George says he likes The nuance of it not being the epic battle of good and evil that ends the story but instead it s the coming back to fact that the real battle is always between the good and evil inside of regular people I think we will see a huge humans vs Others battle but it will end with a scourge of the Shire type human vs human ending Perhaps the bittersweet part is that humans bond together to defeat a greater enemy then fall immediately back into squabbling over what s left I always thought the bittersweet ending in LOTR was that the hobbits fought this epic battle against evil only to come back and realize their daily struggles at home had worsened and their fighting wasn t over Here s a source for GRRM scourage comments	2018-11-27T14:11:17.000Z	Comment	smhDMdCZPc4

Ser Hunts Reviews I disagree with your theory on Jon traveling to King s Landing to meet Cersei after the Night King is defeated If you mean to say this because of the photo leaks for season where Jon and Cersei met I have a diff theory on that Note that it wasn t snowing and their outfits seem to be similar to when they were just crowned king and queen Maybe those events happened before Jon went to Dragonstone back in S to be shown to us in S Maybe Jon after leaving Winterfell dropped by at KL and told Cersei along with some members of the nights watch about the Whitewalkers then promised Cersei he s going there only for dragonglass thereby securing the North from any attacksfrom Cersei while he was away as Sansa did warn him not to underestimate Cersei Then maybe Cersei agreed on one condition make Danaerys believe Jon that she s going to have his alliance Jon could have accepted this and went to Dragonstone just to secure the dragonglass and the North What he didn t expect was that he actually fell for Dany similar to what happened with Ygritte Then when Tyrion and Cersei met maybe Cersei revealed this plan with Jon to Tyrion Therefore explaining Tyrion s worried look about Jon and Dany in the boat I believe Tyrion is a good person and as hand will plan to tell Dany at the right time maybe after the Night King is defeated but also at the same time Jon s true parentage will be revealed We all know how Dany sees liars or spies and this might trigger Danaerys to be angry at Jon which will eventually lead to the final war Just my theory prediction What do u think	2018-11-26T09:39:40.000Z	Reply	smhDMdCZPc4

I also I have a theory that the reason the night king did not kill Drogon and he went after one of the other dragons is because DROGON has a rider already and he knows that he cannot control a dragon that already has a rider so maybe he has Targaren blood or something but that s why he didn t kill DROGON because HE had a rider he needed a dragon without a rider to control	2018-11-25T20:45:33.000Z	Reply	smhDMdCZPc4

although I do not discount much of the Arya hound team up I do not think Hound will kill the Mtn he may balk I believe that the bittersweet ending will have to have some good arc characters die and the once Junk Yard Dog will go down as he is redeemed He may be the Vanenqor He may kiill Cersei then Mtn hand he fight but Hound is mortally wounded and to die but Arya then kills the Mountain with her fast moves after getting him on his knees after she slides under and maybe clips his nuggets with her daggar then she rounds up and as he tries to still end her she does the old flying daggar to other hand and pokes the Mountain into his eye hole into whatever has replaced his brain and it will be the pointy end I hope others do witness this event such as Sansa or Jon or Brianne or Dany or all so Arya ends up being a legend for all future non contended the little girl who took down the Mountain Afterall HE is also on her list So I think you just have the team killing backwards maybe	2018-12-02T00:30:06.000Z	Comment	z8hiEpZ4i0I

I m starting to worry lol hli just can t see how GOT s is going to be long enough to fit everything in like the faceless men and arya thing surely there is a reason the faceless men were so prominent in the other seasons was it all just so arya could change faces get close to enemies to help win the war Surely the whole jaquen Hagar thing couldn t just be for that what about ilaria sand and her daughter are they just dead now then there s the mountain and the hound surely all this seasons of tension can t just end with a min fight to the death and that s that I just feel like there cramming a lot in the end season way to quick like daario naharis is he just gone as well I think they should have made season about the reasoning behind some of the characters that just disappeared made a season for the great war that is also me wishing hoping it can t be the end of GOT LOL	2018-12-01T23:29:54.000Z	Comment	z8hiEpZ4i0I

I think all this points out to a dance of dragons in the final battle Which is not a surprise with Dany having two dragons and the night king one all this evidence from the EW article really supports this such a thing might seem quite impossible from season perspective where the budget obviously was a lot smaller Plus of course these scenes will be shot indoors after the nights outside in the mud	2018-11-08T13:33:19.000Z	Reply	R4ot9ZE-ebI
ItcanbegreatI believe he wants his throne back too one thing ppl have been talking about including this channel is the knight king being the king of the st mens son A lot of ppl think bran is the nk but the most believable thing I ve heard is the king sent his son the prince to parlay with the children of the Forrest but they took him hostage turned him to the knight king Why should the nk be any different from the rest of the characters He s just playing the game of thrones as well	2018-11-08T01:30:53.000Z	Reply	R4ot9ZE-ebI
Talking Thrones I ve also heard that they leased the space in Spain where they film the scenes for the dragon pit for weeks This would lead me to believe there will also be quite the battle there as well	2018-11-07T18:22:19.000Z	Reply	R4ot9ZE-ebI

So i have a theaory no one has thought of i dont think I have stayed quiet until now because i was waiting for some actions to come to life I think that the night king will lead his army to winterfell after leaving a trail of destruction through the north When the night king arrives he is met by the starks at full force I beileve the night king will start to lose severe numbers and realize that he needs more whites At this point he will fly his dragon to kings landing where he will turn his army from to because in season when danerys is in kings landing in her vision from the undying like you said the white walker theme song and the roof looks as if a dragons fire had torched it Thats all i have put together so far it might be trash it could make sensce but i have my tinfoil ready let me kno what you think pls	2018-11-07T14:34:48.000Z	Reply	R4ot9ZE-ebI

The was a great video and from mins on you covered everything I ve ever asked you Sweet I agree Starks have to be there and I never thought because magic bound them there I also thought winterfell is the real throne and maybe it s a curse the night king is trying get back to winterfell He might just be trying to claim his throne Do you think the Starks bloodline is cursed and the only way to defeat it is with fire and ice	2018-11-07T00:46:41.000Z	Reply	R4ot9ZE-ebI

I remember reading or hearing somewhere that Daenys the Dreamer saw the fall of Valeria and that Targaryens in general were very interested in prophecies Add to that Rhaegar Targaryen s own premonitions and concerns about prophecy and his marriage to Lyanna I think many of the Targaryens knew something was coming That lead me to believe that Aegon had a premonition about a threat from the North and that was his reason for invading I think he said something about that premonition to Torrhen Stark and the need for unity That is why Torrhen Stark bent the knee to Aegon without a fight and kept his Valyerian Steel Sword	2018-11-19T09:02:27.000Z	Reply	4jKyTaTAl9Y

I think what will happen is that one good guy from each of the major houses survives I think there will be a lot of sacrificing going on that makes that happen Theon dies to save his sister Jaime dies to save Tyrion and Arya dies to save Sansa But I think the big reveal is something that was hinted at once you kill a higher up undead all the undead under that leader dies instantly I think it will come out that Jon was actually raised by the Lich King and the last episode will be where Jon kills him in front of everyone knowing that he will die also as soon as the lich king dies I think the last scene will be when Dany breaks the wheel by creating a democracy or some type of council rule where you would have Tyrian Sam Yara Sansa Dany and Gendry leading as a group I really think when Dany said she wants to break the wheel it meant she doesn t want it to be a monarchy anymore	2018-11-29T00:24:13.000Z	Comment	Cc4OMnlHIeU

The bittersweet ending will go something like this al the Starks will die except for Arya and her Direwolf she will become the new leader of the faceless men traveling over the kingdoms As John is already dead he won t die another time but will give up the right to be heir king and raises his Son in the lands of always winter Dany will destroy kings landing to save what s left of the humans Theion will accept Winterfell in Brans place and marry Sansa where they live out their years childless The Masters will play a major role in removing all magic and will send the Gold Cloaks after the Lord of Light resulting in widespread destruction and chaos	2018-11-20T00:17:50.000Z	Reply	p_czGsDd2rE

I thought the marketing campaign would start after the holidays because without new content the hype would kinda get lost in the Christmas Chaos As soon as everyone winds down boom hype everyone up for GoT Remember the marketing campaign outline for season that leaked and everyone was like any post using the word bittersweet is written by an HBO intern It showed the schedule for when they d release trailers when they d have events how they were going to take advantage of cons and festivals etc Going by that previous schedule they re starting months early But season was also being released in August not April so maybe they really are going to take advantage of the shopping season for their new figurines in the HBO store and try to keep us hyped for the full months That seems like such a long time to be on tenterhooks though	2018-11-17T18:11:55.000Z	Reply	p_czGsDd2rE

How dumb do you have to be to believe the one picture D D decided to leak themselves as misdirection You guys are making it too easy for them All they had to do was leak one carefully orchestrated spoiler just as they said they would There were no multiple endings shot just a few snaps to throw viewers off and everyone since has been raving of Tyrion s betrayal and all kinds of nonsense cuz they couldn t make sense of a second meeting between Cersei and Jon They are right in not being able to make sense of it cuz it s not happening on the show It was simply taken and leaked so all the GoT tards out there could start reaching with their absurd theories and the one that stuck was Tyrion s betrayal and sending Jon to KL If it s coming from the official source don t believe it If they aren t allowed to snap even their boots while shooting how do you think this snap of Cersei and Jon came to be I ll tell you why cuz the makers not only allowed it but orchestrated it so that you all can behave like human dominos with your theories and Tyrion s betrayal or Jon s meeting with Cersei Let me break it to ya all there will be no second meeting Jon Tyrion or Dany do not meet or come face to face with Cersei again in the remaining story even Jaime doesn t Jon is resurrected the second time through a ritual Dany performs or is part of north of the wall Do you people even hear yourselves Dany burns all of KL cuz she is MK s daughter mind numbingly stupid and simple explanation for imagined crap All are nothing like their fathers Jon cuz he is more like Ned and didn t ever know his father Tyrion is not cruel or ruthless like Tywin and far more intelligent Dany is nothing like MK or she would have already been queen of ashes ending the story seasons ago Ser Hunts I m starting to suspect you are actually getting some kind of commission from D D for promoting their smokescreen tactics Get over this photo of Jon in KL Had they leaked a photo of Dany with Cersei in KL you guys would have come up with theories of Dany s betrayal Do not let a stupid lil snap dictate the outcome of the story Question its authenticity purpose and smell the curry FFS Tyrion will be one of the few survivors on this show and you can take that to the iron bank Jon will not be brought back a second time Makes mockery out of a hero and protagonist Do you really think it will leave any kind of impact from a viewers POV watching the same repetitive resurrection Oh Jon dead again oh no Jon s alive again Jon will die and live forever Stop just stop It s embarrassing	2018-11-20T17:13:35.000Z	Comment	t2Hy1HkEm7c

Aren t Sansa and Tyrion still married Unconsummated but still married It s fun to theorize who might get with who but until the SanTy marriage is addressed in season it s all just speculation I seem to remember Tyrion asking Snow about his wife Sansa and if she missed him on their way to see Dany That tells me they are still married and I can t wait to see their reunion If the SanTy marriage holds that would unite House Lannister and Stark Arya and Gendry would unite House Baratheon and Stark Jon and Dany would be strong allies to House Stark due to Jon s blood line But if the SanTy marriage holds do they live at CR or stay in Winterfell Season can t get here soon enough	2018-11-30T18:52:45.000Z	Comment	72fNEjDMMOA

Talking Thrones Thank you for the great job and videos you make About the heroes discussion scene between Deanerys and Tyrion later in the season when they are discussing the travel north Jorah says to Daenerys that it only take one angry man with a crossbow to kill her and that would make him the hero who killed the conqueror At the same time we are shown Tyrion What would you think is the connection here as I don t think you have mention that in your videos Could it be another foreshadowing for Tyrions betrayal to Daenerys	2018-11-13T05:22:48.000Z	Reply	72fNEjDMMOA
Great thought provoking video Ser After Varys sent assassins to kill the Targs Tyrion told Dany that it was most likely Varys who warned them to flee before the assassins arrived It would appear that Varys is supportive of Dany However Kinvara told him Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason and If you are her Dany true friend you have nothing to fear from me A foreshadowing right It sounds as if Varys may have a ulterior motive and Kinvara just gave him a warning not to see it through I would like to see Arya with Gendry The talk Arya had with Ned is when she was a girl She s a woman now and things change as she s old enough for Gendry to pursue I think it was foreshadowed more that these two would be together when she said You can be my family Gendry replied You would be my lady Sansa Whether she lives or not depends on how dark her character becomes in the first two episodes I have predicted her character will die at WF since Season and I still continue to believe that Sansa fans want her as the Queen of Westeros but she s not right in the head She s either behaving like Ramsay Cersei or LF I can t keep up with her multiple personalities She may become Lady Stoneheart with the character switched from Cat but she still dies all the same Keep up the great work to keep us going until the Long Night	2018-11-13T03:47:19.000Z	Reply	72fNEjDMMOA

I hate to say this but I think this is somewhat accurate I don t know about Tyrion s head rolling toward the camera at the end but I do think he will die at Dany s hand because by then she will have gone full on Mad Queen Emilia Clarke said in an interview Vanity Fair that after she read the script her final scene fucked her up due to knowing that is going to be a lasting flavor in someone s mouth of what Daenerys is Note she didn t say what Dany did but rather what she IS That doesn t bode well It implies ulterior motive a long con deception or the fact that she does go insane after all I think she s going to wind up torching thousands of innocent people even her allies and friends maybe even Jon if it means she gets her throne In the end she will be the real villain of the story bringing all these people together to help her just to turn out like her dad and start the cycle all over again I think that is the bitter part of bittersweet her story ends shitty while there are other happy or at least neutral endings for others the Starks Sam etc	2018-11-26T06:37:23.000Z	Comment	reNBaCkn_aw

I think daenerys is too little like her ancestors and her father This war is not like aegons in any way She doesn t have to defeat several kingdoms she only needs to defeat one person really And they said burning kings landing to the ground would be bad and I just wondered why That is exactly what aegon would have done Just look at harrenhal The greatest castle westeros had ever seen and he asks harren once to bend the knee he said no and on the next day harrens entire bloodline was wiped out Look at the death of the storm king He fought valiantly and lost But they didn t stop in the middle of fighting to give him a chance to give up No orys baratheon killed him Dragons win this war instantly In the current story the only reason they don t is because it would be too easy and boring They make daenerys and especially tyrion stupid simply said Because killing a few thousand if that in the red keep is the easiest fastest and the most human action And it is most certainly what aegon would have done	2018-11-24T09:33:58.000Z	Comment	reNBaCkn_aw

My theory Since there s speculation that the prophecy Lord varys heard was that for the battle to end the true king of the iron throne should be sitting on it is that John will not accept the seat then dany will seat on it Then the battle will be lost and everyone becomes a dead ice guy Then the dragons will in the end kill all the ice men and they rule the world The dragons At this point I m keeping my expectations to the very minimum You know Incase the producers decide to kill everyone I like like Jon dany sansa though I think arya could escape	2018-11-29T17:31:02.000Z	Comment	v5gsVRxzzI4

How dumb do you have to be to believe the one picture D D decided to leak themselves as misdirection You guys are making it too easy for them All they had to do was leak one carefully orchestrated spoiler just as they said they would There were no multiple endings shot just a few snaps to throw viewers off and everyone since has been raving of Tyrion s betrayal and all kinds of nonsense cuz they couldn t make sense of a second meeting between Cersei and Jon They are right in not being able to make sense of it cuz it s not happening on the show It was simply taken and leaked so all the GoT tards out there could start reaching with their absurd theories and the one that stuck was Tyrion s betrayal and sending Jon to KL If it s coming from the official source don t believe it If they aren t allowed to snap even their boots while shooting how do you think this snap of Cersei and Jon came to be I ll tell you why cuz the makers not only allowed it but orchestrated it so that you all can behave like human dominos with your theories and Tyrion s betrayal or Jon s meeting with Cersei Let me break it to ya all there will be no second meeting Jon Tyrion or Dany do not meet or come face to face with Cersei again in the remaining story even Jaime doesn t Jon is resurrected the second time through a ritual Dany performs or is part of north of the wall Do you people even hear yourselves Dany burns all of KL cuz she is MK s daughter mind numbingly stupid and simple explanation for imagined crap All are nothing like their fathers Jon cuz he is more like Ned and didn t ever know his father Tyrion is not cruel or ruthless like Tywin and far more intelligent Dany is nothing like MK or she would have already been queen of ashes ending the story seasons ago Ser Hunts I m starting to suspect you are actually getting some kind of commission from D D for promoting their smokescreen tactics Get over this photo of Jon in KL Had they leaked a photo of Dany with Cersei in KL you guys would have come up with theories of Dany s betrayal Do not let a stupid lil snap dictate the outcome of the story Question its authenticity purpose and smell the curry FFS Tyrion will be one of the few survivors on this show and you can take that to the iron bank Jon will not be brought back a second time Makes mockery out of a hero and protagonist Do you really think it will leave any kind of impact from a viewers POV watching the same repetitive resurrection Oh Jon dead again oh no Jon s alive again Jon will die and live forever Stop just stop It s embarrassing	2018-11-20T17:13:53.000Z	Comment	g8ZdwPFeDUE

I just feel like at this point it wouldn t make a lot of sense for Tyrion to betray Daenerys seeing as Jaime has now walked away from Cersei and is coming north to join the cause If anything I think Tyrion might ve tried to promise Cersei her child would sit on the throne because Daenerys can t have children And the look in the boat thinking what he might ve just done and what if they conceived	2018-11-18T14:29:44.000Z	Comment	g8ZdwPFeDUE

I think we will see House Stark in the prequel and they will be major protagonists along with Naomi Watts We will see Brandon the Breaker the current Night King and Brandon the Builder who built the Wall and the Storms End and other Stark heroes there I think the Starks they will survive via Dannys Jon children if they are twins they can be one Stark and one Targaryen or via Aryas Gendrys children if they are twins one Stark and one Baratheon Sansa and Bran are going to die because they have no more direwolves and because both cant have children Bran because his cripple situation and Sansa because of Ramsays tortures so this left behind the only wellthy choices i describe bellow	2018-11-30T18:23:47.000Z	Comment	9uODpcowplI

Bullshit Jon has always said he is no Stark	2018-11-03T04:27:20.000Z	Comment	btqrrzkBZdQ
I m gonna have to disagree Jon not finding out about his parentage would ve made that ENTIRE scene pointless There s a saying in filmmaking and other media that if a scene ISN T necessary cut it out It s utterly pointless having something solely for the audience Sort of like Chekhov s gun whereby if there s a gun hanging on a wall sooner or later it s gotta go off or it shouldn t be hanging there in the first place Not to mention Bran saying that he needs to know and that they need to tell him That and if I m not mistaken Targaryens have been banging each other for centuries so I don t see the problem The ONLY way I could see what you saying being true is if they try to tell him but die before they can get the message to him But that just sounds stupid and doesn t accomplish anything other than piss off the audience And it s the last season so getting rid of a character to cut costs doesn t make sense	2018-11-03T00:09:47.000Z	Comment	btqrrzkBZdQ

How dumb do you have to be to believe the one picture D D decided to leak themselves as misdirection You guys are making it too easy for them All they had to do was leak one carefully orchestrated spoiler just as they said they would There were no multiple endings shot just a few snaps to throw viewers off and everyone since has been raving of Tyrion s betrayal and all kinds of nonsense cuz they couldn t make sense of a second meeting between Cersei and Jon They are right in not being able to make sense of it cuz it s not happening on the show It was simply taken and leaked so all the GoT tards out there could start reaching with their absurd theories and the one that stuck was Tyrion s betrayal and sending Jon to KL If it s coming from the official source don t believe it If they aren t allowed to snap even their boots while shooting how do you think this snap of Cersei and Jon came to be I ll tell you why cuz the makers not only allowed it but orchestrated it so that you all can behave like human dominos with your theories and Tyrion s betrayal or Jon s meeting with Cersei Let me break it to ya all there will be no second meeting Jon Tyrion or Dany do not meet or come face to face with Cersei again in the remaining story even Jaime doesn t Jon is resurrected the second time through a ritual Dany performs or is part of north of the wall Do you people even hear yourselves Dany burns all of KL cuz she is MK s daughter mind numbingly stupid and simple explanation for imagined crap All are nothing like their fathers Jon cuz he is more like Ned and didn t ever know his father Tyrion is not cruel or ruthless like Tywin and far more intelligent Dany is nothing like MK or she would have already been queen of ashes ending the story seasons ago Ser Hunts I m starting to suspect you are actually getting some kind of commission from D D for promoting their smokescreen tactics Get over this photo of Jon in KL Had they leaked a photo of Dany with Cersei in KL you guys would have come up with theories of Dany s betrayal Do not let a stupid lil snap dictate the outcome of the story Question its authenticity purpose and smell the curry FFS Tyrion will be one of the few survivors on this show and you can take that to the iron bank Jon will not be brought back a second time Makes mockery out of a hero and protagonist Do you really think it will leave any kind of impact from a viewers POV watching the same repetitive resurrection Oh Jon dead again oh no Jon s alive again Jon will die and live forever Stop just stop It s embarrassing	2018-11-20T17:15:53.000Z	Comment	42qzC-Z_TBA

Lol sorry but Peter Dinklage isn t going to say his character will die before the season drops Especially not bluntly like that quote you listed Lol I think its going to come down to him having to choose between his family jamie cersei and maybe baby or lied about fake baby and the people who gave him the respect he deserved and wanted You can see at the end of season that he isn t just being curious There is something more to it Whether it be a plot to kill one or the other D or J or whether just trying to keep penises out of vaginas but def not just noising around for the info Tyrion has always said that he loves his family deeply In season he says he d never take anyone over their family Granted this was before the events of GoT played out the way they did So we ll see where that goes Tyrion is clevel but he has never been known to be a liar tho I m on ambein right now so I maybe forgetting stuff if someone feels like refreshing my mind But yea I wouldn t be surprised if he took a dagger in to Dany s heart after the upcoming battle for Winterfell or even plotted with Jamie to kill his sister I think they d both for that too Thoughts	2018-11-11T08:29:21.000Z	Comment	WKyVnbrDlkE

Do you think the show has merged Jon Snow and Ageon Young Griff Targaryen s characters Meaning book Jon Snow will actually stay dead in the books cause if Jon is Ageon in the books as well then that would just get confusing right	2018-11-05T19:58:10.000Z	Comment	WKyVnbrDlkE

I think the flashback scene with Jon and Dany s child with Davos and being older is or could be a good possibility for the last scene of the series I think that maybe their child is in fact Azor Ahai and that maybe it won t be Jon or Dany that stop the long night but their child that may be the one who actually ends it It seems that maybe also that the iron throne is almost irrelevant at this point But I definitely think that we may see their child perhaps even as an adult	2018-12-01T01:02:05.000Z	Comment	8tisluJE0yM

If Dany is pregnant in season it should be a huge plot twist that nobody should see coming Instead the showrunners have hit the audience over the head with this possible pregnancy What happened to subtle foreshadowing To answer your question if Jon dies wouldn t Dany either be the Queen or Queen regent if the throne passes on to Jon and Dany s child It wouldn t be practical for Dany to be ruling a kingdom from a small island	2018-11-30T00:19:21.000Z	Reply	8tisluJE0yM

One thing you missed is that the Ice Dragon or White Viserion would now have the abilities of the White Walkers and not of the Wights This means that if White Viscerion would happen to breath blue flame onto the Stark Lannister armies then potentially he could turn all of them instantly into Wights and he wouldn t even need the presence of the Night King either Essentially what could happen is that they could split the Dead Army into three units Coming firstly from the West is White Viscerion which could cripple Westeros army Whereas the Night King and his horseman would come next from the East short route and they would flank the Westeros army during the time of confusion Then the main army can come walking slowly directly from the North consisting of all the wights This could flank the Westeros Army and dwindle any chances And it all hinges on the one single detail Viscerion is a White Walker and not a reanimated wight	2018-08-19T16:05:31.000Z	Reply	DhRDOo6qsPc

The thing with the Hound is that to complete his character arch he has to die Which sucks But it makes his character even stronger Building a character in a movie tv show or a video game that people care for isn t easy But with Sandor they did the best job I ve ever seen A character we were almost forced to hate and despise Bc of the side he was on But we spent more time with him throughout the show We saw who he truly was And we saw him become in some ways good This causes a deeper impact a deeper connection with the character Because a character arch like this is something most people can relate to Especially when he helps Sansa and Arya We place ourselves in the girl s shoes Bc we too have had teachers Sometimes we didn t always see what they were teaching us but eventually when we do we appreciate them That was Sandor to Arya and Sansa A teacher Whom they didn t realize had good intentions and truly wanted to help them But now they do see that side of him And so do we as an audience We ve related to him and now we care about him most of us do And the final act to truly make his character arch complete is death We ve all lost someone who was like a teacher to us Whether that be a grandparent a parent or a mentor to us We ve experienced loss We ve lost someone we ve cared for And how they ve built up Sandor so far is very similar We care about him we want the best for him But in the end we are gonna feel actual pain when he dies Bc it s gonna feel like we actually lost a friend or a mentor Thus Sandor is an incredible character with an even better character arch	2018-11-25T21:19:55.000Z	Comment	Lha4bs0TjG0

Too bad he doesn t have a love interest where he could be happy and settle down one day The San San theory just seems wrong and creepy with the age difference and how far apart they look in the show It seems Brienne would make a good match but I can t get over how she complained about no one finding her attractive at the dance where Renly was sweet to her but she doesn t even freakin notice that Tormund is doing exactly what she had wanted She wanted someone to think she was beautiful and sexy and that s EXACTLY what he does People are so stupid never realizing they complain about things that are right under their noses	2018-11-30T22:38:14.000Z	Comment	Lha4bs0TjG0

So im finishing the crypt finaly But in that video i mention one thing so I m doing a full video on that before the crypts let s call it pre And in pre I mention one thing that I m doing a full video on right now Let s call it pre In pre the intro addresses a similar topic but not with Jon With Jaime It s the same thing people judging brothers and sisters or even worse children for their parents mistakes It s definitely going to be a strain early on the season But Jon lEads by example Jon pardoned ned umber and alys karstrark despite their parents crimes So I expect there to be drama but I think they ll see the light If Jon had taken off alys karstarjs head andned umber head then the north and bronze yohn would be like even you know that poisoned blood is a disease And it need s to be purged You re the mad king s grandson How can we trust you How do we know you won t go mad eventually just like he did But nope Jon believes that everyone is an individual There are good apples and bad apples in the freefolk Good apple and bad apples in those south of the wall Good apples and bad apples within each family And because of that he did not blame children for their parents crimes He basically told the world that you should only judge someone based on their own choices and actions He led by example And they re gonna do the same to him They won t see him as aerys grandson Or rhaegar and lyannas child or even as neds child He s his own man Jon snow I don t expect a name change Cause history is lost over time If he change his bame children hundreds of years from now would remember him And strive to be like him But they d remember him as the mystical targaryen A noble born But he s not Technically he is but the past is written He was treated as a bastard his entire life So that makes him a bastard And the world will remember what that fucker I mean the world will remember what thar bastard did	2018-12-01T21:27:12.000Z	Reply	Lha4bs0TjG0
Let me take a step back tho My response wasn t really true I m a very laid back dude And a real nerdy dude who loves this story So when analyzing right now its easy to say id rather not see him bc it doesn t really make sense But in truth I m more laid back than nerdy So if I saw him in s I would yell in a good way and smile ear to ear And I wouldn t even waste time thinking about why it doesn t make sense Cause it is was it is I would just rol with it and love it lol Here s a similar example of a way I already do it So we saw dayne die in the show not in the books And it would be soooo cool if qhorin was dayne in the books and mance was rhaegar But ned told bran in the books that he wouldn t be alive if not for howland So most likely dayne died in the books too If qhorin is not dayne in the books then the mance is rhaegar theory could still work but it loses some of it s appeal So here I am starting to wonder if it s even true in the books And I know for sure qhorin isn t dayne in the show Yet I see him as dayne in the show regardless Applying fan line item veto power Blocking out his death scene and seeing him as dayne bc that s how the story lives inside my head Not sure if that makes sense Basically I wouldn t over analyze it if syrio showed up Id block out the fact thar he ditched arya and I d just embrace him with a smile One last thing so my favorite author brandon sanderson He once said that his books aren t done with his first draft Not done after he makes the editors changes or when it hits bookshelves His stories are only complete once they come to life inside people s head And he encourages people to use line item veto power Because the story isn t his It s the readers story and he applies line item veto to books he reads from other authors I think that s a cool philosophy	2018-12-01T21:12:40.000Z	Reply	Lha4bs0TjG0
bridge Totally I understand that I loved Syrio as a character and he is one of the only characters we don t see die on screen So there will always be that what if for me But I agree with you It s been so damn long that forcing him back into the story would really mess up his character	2018-12-01T20:42:46.000Z	Reply	Lha4bs0TjG0
Definitely not in the books Cause let s say he survived jaqen ditches a year old girl in the middle of wartorn lands Surround my armies and outlaws I would hate to think syrio wasn t really her friend and didn t care about her In the show it d be okay But it still wouldnt make much sense because the scene is about learning the true seeing Syrio tells her Then trant shows up Syrio applies the true seeng and stops arya from going over to trant And then trant splits syrios sword in two at which point arya applies the lesson and runs Actually that s fine As long as he loses it makes sense And that could explain why jaqen is in the dungeons But he still ditches her A little girl So actually I d be against it cause it would change my view of syrio Instead of a father figure who loved her it would mean he s just a heartless dude who pretended to like her But really didn t care Does that make sense	2018-12-01T20:38:23.000Z	Reply	Lha4bs0TjG0

Based upon Mellisandre s words I m guessing she predicted Arya s role as an assassin Firstly she says a darkness within you which I would imply as dark deeds Secondly she says eyes staring back and then lists several different color eyes Obviously Arya can t have all those color eyes Then she says eyes you ll shut forever which could imply her killing spree the eyes of her victims as the dead do not see so their eyes are shut to the world	2018-09-10T22:29:26.000Z	Comment	UNhJbQ3F0hI

Hobodeluxe Miguel Sapochnik is directing episodes and he just finished filming a day or so after Arya Because it s Sapochnik Maisie W most likely had to continue battle scenes with extras It has been foreshadowed that she and Gendry could end up together It would be nice to see her character chill out and become the one thing she didn t want to be a Lady Ned did foreshadow that she would marry a Lord and her sons would be Knights	2018-07-14T16:30:01.000Z	Reply	UNhJbQ3F0hI
Arya is definitely trolling you why in the world would she give away a clue like that especially since they have a non disclosure clause in their contracts the truth is that the real Last woman standing will be Cersei She is always two steps ahead of everybody and has Qyburn making her another Army consisting of the undead white walkers Do you all remember When Jon Snow and his crew brought half of a White Walker and everybody was scared except qyburn did you see how his eyes lit up yep She s going to have him bring Joffrey back and use that already evil little prick into and Undead evil bigger prick to throw everybody off guard and use him to kill Sansa and take advantage of that and use it to kill off a few enemies	2018-07-14T11:13:17.000Z	Reply	UNhJbQ3F0hI

I think Naomi Watts is gonna play the part of the daughter of the Lord Stark before he was turned into the Night King from the Children of the forest It would be interesting how John and Daenarys relationship is gonna carry out due to him being her brother Rhaegar son I think due to that night on the ship she will become pregnant and that child will be born and be the future for the Targarians I would like to see Lady Brienn of Tarf and the wildling Tormund hook up I would like to see Cercei become one of the dead and her killed by her beloved Jamie	2018-11-17T00:04:07.000Z	Comment	_OAstPyQMM0

What i would like to know why did NK tale down Viserion and not Drogon in this clip at you can see Drogon in the foreground before NK throws the spear yet he goes after a further moving target he could have taken Drogon much easier possibly even killing or injuring Dany and some of the others why go after a more difficult to hit target To me it implies he has plans for them kinda off topic from the subject of the video but it got me thinking when i saw that clip	2018-11-20T02:53:02.000Z	Comment	X08xdqFr56Q
The major difference between Bran Stark and The Night King is even if they both are wargs Bran stark can only warg the living species and the night king wargs the deads That is the main reason the night king is controlling Viserion since it s a completely different type of warging because viserion is DEAD And that is why the targarian theory doesn t apply to Viserion s rider Viserion is DEAD	2018-11-19T07:38:21.000Z	Comment	X08xdqFr56Q

Yeah there is definitely a reason especially since Drogon was literally just sitting right there on the ice and so it would have been easy to throw a spear at him Only thing I can think if he doesn t have a plan is that he simply went after the more dangerous threat first Since Drogon was just sitting there the NK might have felt that Viserion or Rhaegal were bigger threats since they were both still flying overhead and could have caused a lot more damage	2018-11-21T20:52:28.000Z	Reply	X08xdqFr56Q
I doubt Missandei would be a dragon rider If we are going with more far fetched theories then I think maybe Melisandre could be a dragon rider She has been around for at least years iirc which means she is older than the throne itself She is also from the magical placed called Asshai she practices magic herself and she has an obsession with fire	2018-11-21T20:57:48.000Z	Reply	X08xdqFr56Q

Was that on the show or just the books If it s only in the books then it might not apply to the show But then again I think the writers have left a lot of stuff out of the show not because they changed things but because they just want to keep things a surprise For example on the show Cersei was never told that she would be killed by the valanqar or however you spell it so a lot of people think maybe that part of the prophecy won t happen on the show However I think the writers left it out on purpose simply because if they had included it then everyone would not only know that she will be killed eventually which ruins the surprise but they would also know that it would be either Jaime or Tyrion This way by not mentioning it on the show they can catch everyone off guard when Jaime suddenly starts strangling her to death or whatever	2018-11-21T21:08:02.000Z	Reply	X08xdqFr56Q
Yeah you re the only person that s looking in the right place The dragons motif we keep hearing about is clearly talking about either types of dragons types of dragon riders or both One fire one ice and one that is both would fit that motif	2018-11-21T21:02:19.000Z	Reply	X08xdqFr56Q

Have you considered Tyrion promised Cersei her baby would be next in line I mean he talked about it with Dany and was concerned because she hadn t named an heir That would also explain why he looked upset on the boat Like Jon he knows the witch might have been lying Thus Jon and Dany having a baby would threaten Tyrion s deal with Cersei Thoughts	2018-12-01T07:14:08.000Z	Comment	wT23H1-u_fQ

I m one of the people who subscribes to the circular deaths theory people die the same way they caused other people to die So lots of people are assuming Cersei will die by getting blown up or something spectacular like that But the first death Cersei put in motion was Robert s and he was gored in the stomach by a boar So I would not be at all surprised to see Cersei get stabbed in the guts And if Qyburn is really a Reyne seeking vengeance against the Lannisters which is another theory I like it would be absolute poetic justice if he were the one to do it	2018-11-27T15:19:14.000Z	Comment	wT23H1-u_fQ

She is not pregnant She talks to Jamie on the map about the kingdom and their legacy Jamie ask what legacy everyone is dead except them two Cercei has to give Jamei a reason to fight on She does the same with Tyrion because she knows he feels responsible for Marcella s death On a side note do you think Cercei fears that Tyrion is the younger sibling that will kill her Cercei knew if she killed Tyrion Dany could and would destroy her Also Cercei thought Tyrion poisoned Jeffry was responsible for Marcella being poisoned and because Tyrion killed Tywin Tomlins mind was poisoned against her Thus Tyrion was choking the life out of her because they were the only thing she loved She did not love Jamie she screwed everything that moved she only loved her children btw I believe Cercei and Jamie are bastards of the mad king therefor Dany is the younger sibling who will kill Cercei	2018-11-12T08:19:41.000Z	Comment	wT23H1-u_fQ

Yes but that is when Jamie asked Cercei what legacy all their children are dead that is when I m saying Cercei realized she needed a stronger argument for taking the throne and to give Jamie a stronger reason to fight So later she told Jamei she was pregnant That map scene was also a feeler for Cercei Jamie that was the first time they talked about Tomlin Cercei may have been feeling Jamie out like was Jamie mad at her did he hold her responsible for Tomlins death She asked Jamie if he was afraid of her he said should I be I think she needed to make sure Jamie was with her so after the map scene she and Kyburn made up the whole baby thing I may be wrong but that scene you showed where Kyburn was talking to Cercei as Jamie was walking in and Kyburn said I could give you something Wasn t that right after Jamie met with Tyrion She asked Jamie what he was going to do about him Jamie said Tyrion And Cercei said no Bron he betrayed you Kyburn might had been offering her poison to kill Bron Wasn t it that scene when she told Jamie she was pregnant Again Jamie just spoke to Tyrion and Cercei may have been afraid that Tyrion was trying to get Jamie to leave her so she pulled out the oh I m pregnant and you are the daddy	2018-11-12T09:37:26.000Z	Reply	wT23H1-u_fQ

It s already been leaked that Jon And Dany both die It all sounds pretty weak and cheesy but let s face it considering the direction this story s been moving it s not really surprising Apparently they both die and Tyrion is left to raise their child along with Missande After all action hero Ken and Malibu Barbie with dragon accessories will die for our bittersweet ending I do actually like Action Ken but personally will be glad to see his aunt bite the dust	2018-08-28T20:58:11.000Z	Comment	iDnXJcAqjiM

Do you think it s possible that Jaime will kill his sister and she ll survive And then then Jaqen will assign her death to Arya because she s still a faceless man So Arya who will kill her So she gets killed by the little brother sister and it s both true	2018-08-01T23:01:05.000Z	Reply	iDnXJcAqjiM

Genuine question In Westeros how gross is an aunt nephew relationship In our world first cousins getting married was considered okay until about a century ago and in some cultures it still is So how much worse is aunt nephew compared to first cousins To me it feels equally gross but I m curious about it from a Westerosi perspective	2018-09-16T19:05:15.000Z	Comment	0hIbFFwTKdE

In most cultures first cousins marrying is still okay Sometimes it s even preferred for some people that s their best option Personally I don t have any problem with cousins marrying cousins First cousins may be problematic but I don t really have a problem with it much less so for second third and fourth cousins First cousins once removed That s fine but once you get to two and three times removed you start to have some big age gaps which leaves room to exploitation and abuse And exploitation and abuse is the one of the bigger reasons why incest is a big no no	2018-10-09T05:41:54.000Z	Reply	0hIbFFwTKdE

Bran is seeing a lot but can he see everything yet Gee things have gotten convoluted I wonder if he knows what transpired between Cersei and Tyrion I am more curious about that than about Podrick and the prostitutes Davos forgave Tyrion for causing his son s death because of the bigger picture the common enemies Could he feel that way about Melisandre now too Arya will have no such temperance and THEIR reunion will be interesting I can t see Sansa falling for Tyrion but I do believe that she can have more of an appreciation of him Remember she left him to face murder charges alone so although he may have forgiven her youth still I really want to see Brienne and Jamie alone together I don t foresee a night of passion but I expect that this will be a reunion to tug the heartstrings Oh I can hardly stand the wait	2018-12-01T04:02:48.000Z	Comment	7cdEH1V9Ehc

Danny meeting undead Viserion will be sad and devastating I think Jons parentage reveal might cause some problem to them but i think it will be only for a few because she will reveal to him that is pregnant with his child and Jon will decide to marry her for the baby to have a father and a mother and not be bastard Thats my prediction The most interesting meeting for me will be Cercei NK Im wonder how she will react to the threat that she hopes wipes out her enemies she thinks that she is safe now that has the GC comes so she meets the NK will be kinda ironic	2018-11-25T22:17:06.000Z	Comment	7cdEH1V9Ehc

I don t think too much can be made of the photo of Jon and Dany It looks more standard publicity than hint of passion of lack there of to come Dany might be adding Targ red to her outfit but it is Jon that has the look of leader in his eyes bravely looking into the future Actually Dany looks a bit diminished not looking out with a commanding look as she did in earlier seasons As far as the red cape goes hard to tell if it belongs to Dany worn over her left shoulder or the lining of Jon s cape If this is the same costume we saw in the earlier photos of her tour she wasn t wearing any cape I don t think we can jump to conclusions about Jon s costume either yes the cape appears the same except maybe for a possible red lining All other details under the cape are hidden by Dany s body	2018-11-04T19:29:59.000Z	Comment	bXn1kpQ3SIo

Thanks to you as always I think this looks like a publicity pose because why would they both be looking into the camera For many reasons Season has to be a big one As you said Season was a let down it was not at all up to previous seasons standards If they want to keep the franchise sales of merchandise DVDs and especially the prequels they HAVE to step their game back up They have to give us answers big scenes and tie up a number of ends to keep we fans happy by giving us enough time in episodes to see it all There is too much at stake for them to blow it totally now I know that I will certainly not buy the last seasons more merchandise or even think about shelling out the extra money to keep HBO beyond the last episode if I am as very disappointed as disappointed as I was in Season	2018-11-02T20:56:37.000Z	Comment	bXn1kpQ3SIo
