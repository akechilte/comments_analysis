Granted the Producers said Lady Stoneheart wouldn t feature in the show but since they re keeping Season under wraps do you think she could make a little cameo given that Jamie Lannister is heading up north and via the Riverlands I mean that would be a serious WTF moment for Emergency Awesome to cover don t you think Another character I d love to see again is Stannis leading the Golden Company and once they make it across the Narrow Sea to Westeros they side with the North and turn on Cersei	2018-12-03T00:10:42.000Z	Reply	r-rCOSayAr8	Game Of Thrones Season Trailer News and Robb Stark Reacts To The Red Wedding Scene

Talking Thrones My question is this Why did Arya s direwolf not stay with her Unless she is the Waif and the direwolf was confused by her appearance I don t really remember much of the Waif and Arya s battle other than that Arys s wound looked fatal Did Jagen H ghar send the Waif to kill Arya and if so it seems unlikely that he would not see the job finished Was this storyline much different than in the books Thanks to anyone that can clear this up	2018-11-30T04:06:02.000Z	Comment	R4ot9ZE-ebI	House Stark of Winterfell: Their True Purpose? - Game of Thrones Season 8 (End Game Theory)

Here was my theory from over two years ago The Night King can raise the dead The crypts in Winterfell are FAR more vast than the castle or grounds with all the Kings and warriors of the North buried there There must always be a Stark in Winterfell because if the Night King comes south and raises the dead from the Crypts they will rise but they ll be under the command of the Stark in Winterfell	2018-11-26T02:36:30.000Z	Comment	R4ot9ZE-ebI	House Stark of Winterfell: Their True Purpose? - Game of Thrones Season 8 (End Game Theory)

I think all this points out to a dance of dragons in the final battle Which is not a surprise with Dany having two dragons and the night king one all this evidence from the EW article really supports this such a thing might seem quite impossible from season perspective where the budget obviously was a lot smaller Plus of course these scenes will be shot indoors after the nights outside in the mud	2018-11-08T13:33:19.000Z	Reply	R4ot9ZE-ebI	House Stark of Winterfell Their True Purpose Game of Thrones Season End Game Theory
ItcanbegreatI believe he wants his throne back too one thing ppl have been talking about including this channel is the knight king being the king of the st mens son A lot of ppl think bran is the nk but the most believable thing I ve heard is the king sent his son the prince to parlay with the children of the Forrest but they took him hostage turned him to the knight king Why should the nk be any different from the rest of the characters He s just playing the game of thrones as well	2018-11-08T01:30:53.000Z	Reply	R4ot9ZE-ebI	House Stark of Winterfell Their True Purpose Game of Thrones Season End Game Theory

So i have a theaory no one has thought of i dont think I have stayed quiet until now because i was waiting for some actions to come to life I think that the night king will lead his army to winterfell after leaving a trail of destruction through the north When the night king arrives he is met by the starks at full force I beileve the night king will start to lose severe numbers and realize that he needs more whites At this point he will fly his dragon to kings landing where he will turn his army from to because in season when danerys is in kings landing in her vision from the undying like you said the white walker theme song and the roof looks as if a dragons fire had torched it Thats all i have put together so far it might be trash it could make sensce but i have my tinfoil ready let me kno what you think pls	2018-11-07T14:34:48.000Z	Reply	R4ot9ZE-ebI	House Stark of Winterfell Their True Purpose Game of Thrones Season End Game Theory

I think what will happen is that one good guy from each of the major houses survives I think there will be a lot of sacrificing going on that makes that happen Theon dies to save his sister Jaime dies to save Tyrion and Arya dies to save Sansa But I think the big reveal is something that was hinted at once you kill a higher up undead all the undead under that leader dies instantly I think it will come out that Jon was actually raised by the Lich King and the last episode will be where Jon kills him in front of everyone knowing that he will die also as soon as the lich king dies I think the last scene will be when Dany breaks the wheel by creating a democracy or some type of council rule where you would have Tyrian Sam Yara Sansa Dany and Gendry leading as a group I really think when Dany said she wants to break the wheel it meant she doesn t want it to be a monarchy anymore	2018-11-29T00:24:13.000Z	Comment	Cc4OMnlHIeU	Game Of Thrones Season 8: Predicting The Fate Of Every Character

The level of inbreeding and madness among the Targaryen dynasty has been grossly overstated by fandom and especially by the TV show Their detailed family tree in TWOIAF struck me by how LITTLE inbreeding and madness actualy occurred relative to what everyone thinks Interestingly Daenerys s parents the mad King Aerys II and his sister wife Queen Rhaella were themselves the st in the family born of an incestuous union in over years or thereabouts I have always thought that the madness situation has less to do with genetics and more to do with the extremely potent and perilous power of the Dragonlord lineage to which the Targaryens belong It seems that when madness occurs the afflicted person quite literally takes on the most terrifying characteristics of a dragon with an obsession with power violence and fire And even more fascinating those who do go mad are almost all male not female	2018-11-28T07:21:54.000Z	Comment	smhDMdCZPc4	"Fire and Blood ""LEAKED"" Daenerys End Game!

I love how enthusiastic you are Dany will sentence Jamie to death and that is when Tyrion will betray her and set up a meeting with Cersei and Jon to save his family I think Dany will simply hear about a Jon and Cersei meeting FROM VARYS and that will set her off She will burn Tyrion and go to KL and burn everything else Her fate as a crazy Targ is sealed I seriously do not think she is fit to rule Kingdoms especially without Tyrion She has no experience and she is just a warrior If she were rational she would have stayed in Dragonstone and just created more Dragons The Greyjoys will end up shooting her down And she will crash in the ocean and die Or Jon jumps on a Dragon and he has to kill her to stop her Jon sees people burning and dying and has to make a choice Making Jon do what Jamie did Break an oath and kill a Queen This will leave Dragon alive for Jon to ride and battle the Night King I think the Night King is a Targ Greenseer And Dragons eggs being stolen and given them to a Targ Female woke them TOO much Fire Not enough Ice The wars are over Later Jamie Impressed with Jon Knows what he has to do He goes to Cersei and with no warning chokes her to death Jamie pounces like a lion His violent acts are always unexpected ALWAYS and without warning He goes down in History as King Jamie The Golden Hand of Justice He marries Brianne and will father amazing blonde babies named Lannister He never got Ned s respect But he gets Jon s King Jon Whitewolf STARK King of the North Sansa Lady of the Vale Arya of the Twins Tulleys of Riverrun Gendry of the Stormlands Samwell Lord of the Reach Bron gets his focken Castle Casterly Rock	2018-11-28T02:23:37.000Z	Comment	smhDMdCZPc4	"Fire and Blood ""LEAKED"" Daenerys End Game!

I m sorry I just feel like there is no way Dany will die at the end of Thrones She still needs to give birth to a whole baby lol And I don t want to believe GRRM would literally spend years of building Jon and Dany s characters up with parallels that mirrored each other as if they were two of the same only to kill off one or the other tragically Their union I believe will bring peace and harmony in the new generation of Westeros uniting both the magic of the Starks and Targaryens so there will be an even balance of magic within the world I picked up on Qyburn telling Pycelle just before he got killed at the end of s TWOW And sometimes before we can usher in the new the old must be put to rest	2018-11-28T00:20:12.000Z	Comment	smhDMdCZPc4	"Fire and Blood ""LEAKED"" Daenerys End Game!

I completely agree that we may be wrong in hating the forthethrone marketing campaign GRRM has said that his favorite part of the LOTR books is the melancholy end the scourge of the Shire It s not an apocalypse ending it s a political hobbit vs hobbit struggle for control of their land ending Feels almost anticlimactic which is what George says he likes The nuance of it not being the epic battle of good and evil that ends the story but instead it s the coming back to fact that the real battle is always between the good and evil inside of regular people I think we will see a huge humans vs Others battle but it will end with a scourge of the Shire type human vs human ending Perhaps the bittersweet part is that humans bond together to defeat a greater enemy then fall immediately back into squabbling over what s left I always thought the bittersweet ending in LOTR was that the hobbits fought this epic battle against evil only to come back and realize their daily struggles at home had worsened and their fighting wasn t over Here s a source for GRRM scourage comments	2018-11-27T14:11:17.000Z	Comment	smhDMdCZPc4	"Fire and Blood ""LEAKED"" Daenerys End Game!

Ser Hunts Reviews I disagree with your theory on Jon traveling to King s Landing to meet Cersei after the Night King is defeated If you mean to say this because of the photo leaks for season where Jon and Cersei met I have a diff theory on that Note that it wasn t snowing and their outfits seem to be similar to when they were just crowned king and queen Maybe those events happened before Jon went to Dragonstone back in S to be shown to us in S Maybe Jon after leaving Winterfell dropped by at KL and told Cersei along with some members of the nights watch about the Whitewalkers then promised Cersei he s going there only for dragonglass thereby securing the North from any attacksfrom Cersei while he was away as Sansa did warn him not to underestimate Cersei Then maybe Cersei agreed on one condition make Danaerys believe Jon that she s going to have his alliance Jon could have accepted this and went to Dragonstone just to secure the dragonglass and the North What he didn t expect was that he actually fell for Dany similar to what happened with Ygritte Then when Tyrion and Cersei met maybe Cersei revealed this plan with Jon to Tyrion Therefore explaining Tyrion s worried look about Jon and Dany in the boat I believe Tyrion is a good person and as hand will plan to tell Dany at the right time maybe after the Night King is defeated but also at the same time Jon s true parentage will be revealed We all know how Dany sees liars or spies and this might trigger Danaerys to be angry at Jon which will eventually lead to the final war Just my theory prediction What do u think	2018-11-26T09:39:40.000Z	Reply	smhDMdCZPc4	Fire and Blood LEAKED Daenerys End Game Game Of Thrones Season Leaked Scenes

I also I have a theory that the reason the night king did not kill Drogon and he went after one of the other dragons is because DROGON has a rider already and he knows that he cannot control a dragon that already has a rider so maybe he has Targaren blood or something but that s why he didn t kill DROGON because HE had a rider he needed a dragon without a rider to control	2018-11-25T20:45:33.000Z	Reply	smhDMdCZPc4	Fire and Blood LEAKED Daenerys End Game Game Of Thrones Season Leaked Scenes

I think the flashback scene with Jon and Dany s child with Davos and being older is or could be a good possibility for the last scene of the series I think that maybe their child is in fact Azor Ahai and that maybe it won t be Jon or Dany that stop the long night but their child that may be the one who actually ends it It seems that maybe also that the iron throne is almost irrelevant at this point But I definitely think that we may see their child perhaps even as an adult	2018-12-01T01:02:05.000Z	Comment	8tisluJE0yM	2 End Game 'LEAKED' Scenes!

Ser Hunts Reviews If we think of the war of the roses theory Dany would be Henry VII and Jon the closer would Elizabeth of York declared bastard but still heir to a house but she also has a lot of similaries with Sansa but go with me with this who died before of her husband while giving birth to a daughter according to popular believe she never even looked at Also her marriege with Henry ended the war of the roses and begining of the begining of the Golden Age of England and one of the biggest if not the biggest dynasty of england the tudors and we all know GRRM loves history so my money is on history for now	2018-11-29T23:28:36.000Z	Reply	8tisluJE0yM	End Game LEAKED Scenes Game Of Thrones Season Leaked Scenes

I remember reading or hearing somewhere that Daenys the Dreamer saw the fall of Valeria and that Targaryens in general were very interested in prophecies Add to that Rhaegar Targaryen s own premonitions and concerns about prophecy and his marriage to Lyanna I think many of the Targaryens knew something was coming That lead me to believe that Aegon had a premonition about a threat from the North and that was his reason for invading I think he said something about that premonition to Torrhen Stark and the need for unity That is why Torrhen Stark bent the knee to Aegon without a fight and kept his Valyerian Steel Sword	2018-11-19T09:02:27.000Z	Reply	4jKyTaTAl9Y	Game Of Thrones Season Aegon Targaryen s Secret Jon Snow Plan Explained

I thought the marketing campaign would start after the holidays because without new content the hype would kinda get lost in the Christmas Chaos As soon as everyone winds down boom hype everyone up for GoT Remember the marketing campaign outline for season that leaked and everyone was like any post using the word bittersweet is written by an HBO intern It showed the schedule for when they d release trailers when they d have events how they were going to take advantage of cons and festivals etc Going by that previous schedule they re starting months early But season was also being released in August not April so maybe they really are going to take advantage of the shopping season for their new figurines in the HBO store and try to keep us hyped for the full months That seems like such a long time to be on tenterhooks though	2018-11-17T18:11:55.000Z	Reply	p_czGsDd2rE	Game Of Thrones Season Release Date Trailer Easter Eggs and Winds of Winter

How dumb do you have to be to believe the one picture D D decided to leak themselves as misdirection You guys are making it too easy for them All they had to do was leak one carefully orchestrated spoiler just as they said they would There were no multiple endings shot just a few snaps to throw viewers off and everyone since has been raving of Tyrion s betrayal and all kinds of nonsense cuz they couldn t make sense of a second meeting between Cersei and Jon They are right in not being able to make sense of it cuz it s not happening on the show It was simply taken and leaked so all the GoT tards out there could start reaching with their absurd theories and the one that stuck was Tyrion s betrayal and sending Jon to KL If it s coming from the official source don t believe it If they aren t allowed to snap even their boots while shooting how do you think this snap of Cersei and Jon came to be I ll tell you why cuz the makers not only allowed it but orchestrated it so that you all can behave like human dominos with your theories and Tyrion s betrayal or Jon s meeting with Cersei Let me break it to ya all there will be no second meeting Jon Tyrion or Dany do not meet or come face to face with Cersei again in the remaining story even Jaime doesn t Jon is resurrected the second time through a ritual Dany performs or is part of north of the wall Do you people even hear yourselves Dany burns all of KL cuz she is MK s daughter mind numbingly stupid and simple explanation for imagined crap All are nothing like their fathers Jon cuz he is more like Ned and didn t ever know his father Tyrion is not cruel or ruthless like Tywin and far more intelligent Dany is nothing like MK or she would have already been queen of ashes ending the story seasons ago Ser Hunts I m starting to suspect you are actually getting some kind of commission from D D for promoting their smokescreen tactics Get over this photo of Jon in KL Had they leaked a photo of Dany with Cersei in KL you guys would have come up with theories of Dany s betrayal Do not let a stupid lil snap dictate the outcome of the story Question its authenticity purpose and smell the curry FFS Tyrion will be one of the few survivors on this show and you can take that to the iron bank Jon will not be brought back a second time Makes mockery out of a hero and protagonist Do you really think it will leave any kind of impact from a viewers POV watching the same repetitive resurrection Oh Jon dead again oh no Jon s alive again Jon will die and live forever Stop just stop It s embarrassing	2018-11-20T17:13:35.000Z	Comment	t2Hy1HkEm7c	'LEAKED' End Game Scene!

Read all the books and will start rereading them this Christmas I have to say it s the most incredible piece of fiction I ve ever read It astounds me how GRRM managed it It s like I m reading about ancient history like it is so perfectly connected that it could actually be real No wonder he is so pressured and blocked to continue writing It must be exhausting to deliver something so great and flawless	2018-11-18T03:09:02.000Z	Comment	t2Hy1HkEm7c	'LEAKED' End Game Scene!

Talking Thrones Thank you for the great job and videos you make About the heroes discussion scene between Deanerys and Tyrion later in the season when they are discussing the travel north Jorah says to Daenerys that it only take one angry man with a crossbow to kill her and that would make him the hero who killed the conqueror At the same time we are shown Tyrion What would you think is the connection here as I don t think you have mention that in your videos Could it be another foreshadowing for Tyrions betrayal to Daenerys	2018-11-13T05:22:48.000Z	Reply	72fNEjDMMOA	Varys Told Us What Would Happen In The End Game of Thrones Season End Game Theories
Great thought provoking video Ser After Varys sent assassins to kill the Targs Tyrion told Dany that it was most likely Varys who warned them to flee before the assassins arrived It would appear that Varys is supportive of Dany However Kinvara told him Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason and If you are her Dany true friend you have nothing to fear from me A foreshadowing right It sounds as if Varys may have a ulterior motive and Kinvara just gave him a warning not to see it through I would like to see Arya with Gendry The talk Arya had with Ned is when she was a girl She s a woman now and things change as she s old enough for Gendry to pursue I think it was foreshadowed more that these two would be together when she said You can be my family Gendry replied You would be my lady Sansa Whether she lives or not depends on how dark her character becomes in the first two episodes I have predicted her character will die at WF since Season and I still continue to believe that Sansa fans want her as the Queen of Westeros but she s not right in the head She s either behaving like Ramsay Cersei or LF I can t keep up with her multiple personalities She may become Lady Stoneheart with the character switched from Cat but she still dies all the same Keep up the great work to keep us going until the Long Night	2018-11-13T03:47:19.000Z	Reply	72fNEjDMMOA	Varys Told Us What Would Happen In The End Game of Thrones Season End Game Theories

I have a neat little thought do you think the reason benjens body was left was to be taken back because he is a stark after all and the nightswatch would probably try to get his body home do you think he may have been some sort of trap and that s why they left him to die and did not just finish him off we know they don t care about killing lol just a thought would love to hear yours on it	2018-11-09T19:55:32.000Z	Reply	anduMzM1jNk	Benjen Stark Knew The Truth About EVERYTHING Game of Thrones Season End Game Theory

My theory Since there s speculation that the prophecy Lord varys heard was that for the battle to end the true king of the iron throne should be sitting on it is that John will not accept the seat then dany will seat on it Then the battle will be lost and everyone becomes a dead ice guy Then the dragons will in the end kill all the ice men and they rule the world The dragons At this point I m keeping my expectations to the very minimum You know Incase the producers decide to kill everyone I like like Jon dany sansa though I think arya could escape	2018-11-29T17:31:02.000Z	Comment	v5gsVRxzzI4	Game of Thrones Season 8 Teaser Trailer #1 (2019) Emilia Clarke, Kit Harington / Trailer Concept

How dumb do you have to be to believe the one picture D D decided to leak themselves as misdirection You guys are making it too easy for them All they had to do was leak one carefully orchestrated spoiler just as they said they would There were no multiple endings shot just a few snaps to throw viewers off and everyone since has been raving of Tyrion s betrayal and all kinds of nonsense cuz they couldn t make sense of a second meeting between Cersei and Jon They are right in not being able to make sense of it cuz it s not happening on the show It was simply taken and leaked so all the GoT tards out there could start reaching with their absurd theories and the one that stuck was Tyrion s betrayal and sending Jon to KL If it s coming from the official source don t believe it If they aren t allowed to snap even their boots while shooting how do you think this snap of Cersei and Jon came to be I ll tell you why cuz the makers not only allowed it but orchestrated it so that you all can behave like human dominos with your theories and Tyrion s betrayal or Jon s meeting with Cersei Let me break it to ya all there will be no second meeting Jon Tyrion or Dany do not meet or come face to face with Cersei again in the remaining story even Jaime doesn t Jon is resurrected the second time through a ritual Dany performs or is part of north of the wall Do you people even hear yourselves Dany burns all of KL cuz she is MK s daughter mind numbingly stupid and simple explanation for imagined crap All are nothing like their fathers Jon cuz he is more like Ned and didn t ever know his father Tyrion is not cruel or ruthless like Tywin and far more intelligent Dany is nothing like MK or she would have already been queen of ashes ending the story seasons ago Ser Hunts I m starting to suspect you are actually getting some kind of commission from D D for promoting their smokescreen tactics Get over this photo of Jon in KL Had they leaked a photo of Dany with Cersei in KL you guys would have come up with theories of Dany s betrayal Do not let a stupid lil snap dictate the outcome of the story Question its authenticity purpose and smell the curry FFS Tyrion will be one of the few survivors on this show and you can take that to the iron bank Jon will not be brought back a second time Makes mockery out of a hero and protagonist Do you really think it will leave any kind of impact from a viewers POV watching the same repetitive resurrection Oh Jon dead again oh no Jon s alive again Jon will die and live forever Stop just stop It s embarrassing	2018-11-20T17:13:53.000Z	Comment	g8ZdwPFeDUE	'LEAKED' Episode 2 Scene!

There is no valonqar Prophecies used to make people act certain ways Summerhall whatever Rhaegar did and Dany s kept them in mind but went with her gut ignored them Cersei was going to be Queen no matter what because of Tywin she broke the prophecy early and that s why she forgot about it until AFFC However Cersei s taken Aerys place pretty much much like Dany has Cersei wins GOT for ignoring prophecy and focusing on herself which after all is said and done MAY be what the prophecy intended It s plausible those who prophesy BR Bran EC prophetic sorts should just shut up instead of trying to change things with prophecies in GRRM s world it makes the CotF EC the bad guys Cersei s winning this and SO is Jon Dany Bran and the trees are going down Arya might try to stick Jon with pointy end hope she fails	2018-12-03T04:03:25.000Z	Comment	z8hiEpZ4i0I	SEASON 8 Cersei’s Death Confirmed ?! | Game of Thrones

My money is on Euron The term Valonqar might be gender neutral however the grammar used in the prophecy is not It says the valonqar will wrap HIS hands He is male which passes Daenerys Sansa etc out However Arya could wear a male face Valonqar is the only term in the whole prophecy in Valyrian language so he most likely has ties to Valyria which passes Arya out with or without Jaime s face and also Sandor Clegane Euron had been to Valyria travelled the ruins and owns an armour of Valyrian steel The nd male candidate that comes into question would be Jon Snow who has valyrian blood and is the little brother of Aegon VI and Rhaenys at least in the show there might be a few more persons in the books Euron is Balon Greyjoy s younger brother Strongest hint When Cersei recalls her visit at Maggy the Frog in her dream she wanted to warn the girls but she couldn t talk because she had no tongue anymore AFFC Cersei POV And as we know Euron is infamous for cutting tongues out Im pretty sure Euron will kill Cersei because he wants to become king himself And Im also sure we won t have to wait til the finale for her demise	2018-12-02T16:59:32.000Z	Comment	z8hiEpZ4i0I	SEASON 8 Cersei’s Death Confirmed ?! | Game of Thrones

Wouldn t it be awesome if one of the twists promised was that Arya and the Hound would enter King s Landing with the intention of killing Cersei and the Mountain only for the Hound to kill Cersei and Arya to kill the Mountain Sandor told Gregor You know who is coming for you You ve always known We re meant to think he refers to himself or perhaps to The Stranger Death But what if he meant Arya He knew the Mountain was on her list Also Sandor is a little brother who could easily choke Cersei to death Just a thought	2018-12-02T07:47:40.000Z	Comment	z8hiEpZ4i0I	SEASON 8 Cersei’s Death Confirmed ?! | Game of Thrones

I hate to say this but I think this is somewhat accurate I don t know about Tyrion s head rolling toward the camera at the end but I do think he will die at Dany s hand because by then she will have gone full on Mad Queen Emilia Clarke said in an interview Vanity Fair that after she read the script her final scene fucked her up due to knowing that is going to be a lasting flavor in someone s mouth of what Daenerys is Note she didn t say what Dany did but rather what she IS That doesn t bode well It implies ulterior motive a long con deception or the fact that she does go insane after all I think she s going to wind up torching thousands of innocent people even her allies and friends maybe even Jon if it means she gets her throne In the end she will be the real villain of the story bringing all these people together to help her just to turn out like her dad and start the cycle all over again I think that is the bitter part of bittersweet her story ends shitty while there are other happy or at least neutral endings for others the Starks Sam etc	2018-11-26T06:37:23.000Z	Comment	reNBaCkn_aw	'Not My Forebearer' LEAKED Scene!

I think daenerys is too little like her ancestors and her father This war is not like aegons in any way She doesn t have to defeat several kingdoms she only needs to defeat one person really And they said burning kings landing to the ground would be bad and I just wondered why That is exactly what aegon would have done Just look at harrenhal The greatest castle westeros had ever seen and he asks harren once to bend the knee he said no and on the next day harrens entire bloodline was wiped out Look at the death of the storm king He fought valiantly and lost But they didn t stop in the middle of fighting to give him a chance to give up No orys baratheon killed him Dragons win this war instantly In the current story the only reason they don t is because it would be too easy and boring They make daenerys and especially tyrion stupid simply said Because killing a few thousand if that in the red keep is the easiest fastest and the most human action And it is most certainly what aegon would have done	2018-11-24T09:33:58.000Z	Comment	reNBaCkn_aw	'Not My Forebearer' LEAKED Scene!

Ned is not Jon s father though nurture wise Yes But genetically he is Rhagar s son and Jon acts a lot like him Hope the leaks are not true because killing Jon a second time and bringing him back would be pathetic jump the shark and ruin the series They came close last year with putting chains on and then pulling the dead dragon out of the lake when the dead are not supposed to do well in water Dany has shown signs of madness As for Tyrion I see him betraying whom ever for what he thinks are noble reasons but they may not be the right reasons In the end he will see where he messed up and accept his fate in a bittersweet type ending	2018-11-22T14:17:20.000Z	Comment	reNBaCkn_aw	'Not My Forebearer' LEAKED Scene!

Master Chuck Nah we should focus on both as if they were the light and dark sitting on our characters shoulders Tyrion should be a Red Herring and isn t considered as he grew up in his father s shadow were as Jon and Dany s father s died before their mothers What is Rhaegar s and Ned s sin that gets him killed They both lacked foresight right Rhaegar or Ned didn t expect to die and both expected to squash the controversy taking over the realm but were killed instead What is Aerys Sin that gets him killed Gullibility He took Pycylle and Varys word to open the gates and let Tywin s army into the city You should expect Dany and Jon to repeat pay for or make the same decisions their father s made If you can think of any other way Lyanna and Rhaella are important in terms of mythic structure other than being vessels for the hero es I d love to hear it	2018-11-21T16:14:50.000Z	Reply	reNBaCkn_aw	Not My Forebearer LEAKED Scene Game Of Thrones Season Leaked Scenes

My sister told me about how GoT season ended She listened to the entire script online that the HBO hackers leaked It was released in the middle of filming season For financial purposes I doubt it if the producers and director s scrapped what was released and started an entire different middle and end I know what happens and I m still super excited to see it play out	2018-11-19T02:23:20.000Z	Comment	WKyVnbrDlkE	Game Of Thrones Season 8 Tyrion and Ned Stark Special Episode Explained

Lol sorry but Peter Dinklage isn t going to say his character will die before the season drops Especially not bluntly like that quote you listed Lol I think its going to come down to him having to choose between his family jamie cersei and maybe baby or lied about fake baby and the people who gave him the respect he deserved and wanted You can see at the end of season that he isn t just being curious There is something more to it Whether it be a plot to kill one or the other D or J or whether just trying to keep penises out of vaginas but def not just noising around for the info Tyrion has always said that he loves his family deeply In season he says he d never take anyone over their family Granted this was before the events of GoT played out the way they did So we ll see where that goes Tyrion is clevel but he has never been known to be a liar tho I m on ambein right now so I maybe forgetting stuff if someone feels like refreshing my mind But yea I wouldn t be surprised if he took a dagger in to Dany s heart after the upcoming battle for Winterfell or even plotted with Jamie to kill his sister I think they d both for that too Thoughts	2018-11-11T08:29:21.000Z	Comment	WKyVnbrDlkE	Game Of Thrones Season 8 Tyrion and Ned Stark Special Episode Explained

I m gonna have to disagree Jon not finding out about his parentage would ve made that ENTIRE scene pointless There s a saying in filmmaking and other media that if a scene ISN T necessary cut it out It s utterly pointless having something solely for the audience Sort of like Chekhov s gun whereby if there s a gun hanging on a wall sooner or later it s gotta go off or it shouldn t be hanging there in the first place Not to mention Bran saying that he needs to know and that they need to tell him That and if I m not mistaken Targaryens have been banging each other for centuries so I don t see the problem The ONLY way I could see what you saying being true is if they try to tell him but die before they can get the message to him But that just sounds stupid and doesn t accomplish anything other than piss off the audience And it s the last season so getting rid of a character to cut costs doesn t make sense	2018-11-03T00:09:47.000Z	Comment	btqrrzkBZdQ	LEAKED S8 Trailer Outline!

The thing with the Hound is that to complete his character arch he has to die Which sucks But it makes his character even stronger Building a character in a movie tv show or a video game that people care for isn t easy But with Sandor they did the best job I ve ever seen A character we were almost forced to hate and despise Bc of the side he was on But we spent more time with him throughout the show We saw who he truly was And we saw him become in some ways good This causes a deeper impact a deeper connection with the character Because a character arch like this is something most people can relate to Especially when he helps Sansa and Arya We place ourselves in the girl s shoes Bc we too have had teachers Sometimes we didn t always see what they were teaching us but eventually when we do we appreciate them That was Sandor to Arya and Sansa A teacher Whom they didn t realize had good intentions and truly wanted to help them But now they do see that side of him And so do we as an audience We ve related to him and now we care about him most of us do And the final act to truly make his character arch complete is death We ve all lost someone who was like a teacher to us Whether that be a grandparent a parent or a mentor to us We ve experienced loss We ve lost someone we ve cared for And how they ve built up Sandor so far is very similar We care about him we want the best for him But in the end we are gonna feel actual pain when he dies Bc it s gonna feel like we actually lost a friend or a mentor Thus Sandor is an incredible character with an even better character arch	2018-11-25T21:19:55.000Z	Comment	Lha4bs0TjG0	The Hound's Death explained | Game of Thrones Season 8
I like your theory and perhaps I ve just moved it along a little more Why did the Mountain hold the Hound s face in the fire Because of a fight over a toy we ve always been told But seeing as we now know the Hound can see visions in the flames and when the Hound told the Mountain You ve always known who s coming for you then perhaps it wasn t a fight over a toy after all Perhaps the Hound had seen the Mountain s death described it and the Mountain burned the Hound s face in rage Seems reasonable to me Go Arya	2018-12-02T20:46:10.000Z	Comment	Lha4bs0TjG0	The Hound's Death explained | Game of Thrones Season 8

Joe Blow You are correct And I think Jaime s arc is more compelling because it is bigger Sandor went from a grumpy b d who killed people out of cynicism to a grumpy b d who kills people out of a sense of purpose It s impressive for sure but not fundamentally transformative to his character He is who he always was merely with more just justifications for his actions Jaime has gone from utterly selfish with a tiny suppressed nugget of higher purpose to a man who lives for purpose only and has apparently discarded the last of his selfish persona Jaime is a fundamentally different person at the end of his arc Sandor s arc is within our grasps as normal people We could all live his arc ourselves if not killing people then something we do that is less bloody where we learn to let our better self out but are largely the same person It s a nice story Jaime s arc is epic It s beyond the grasp of normal people and is more like an arc rarely seen where someone gives up everything to be a missionary in the slums of Calcutta for example It s the complete abandonment of one safe life focused on self to an insecure life focused on others There are many character arcs in GOT where the characters end up better versions or worse versions but they mostly end up dead of themselves There is only one arc however where the person at the end has no resemblance to the person at the beginning Jaime is the only character who sits wholly unrecognizable entering Season from where they started in Season	2018-12-03T01:40:22.000Z	Reply	Lha4bs0TjG0	The Hound s Death explained Game of Thrones Season

So im finishing the crypt finaly But in that video i mention one thing so I m doing a full video on that before the crypts let s call it pre And in pre I mention one thing that I m doing a full video on right now Let s call it pre In pre the intro addresses a similar topic but not with Jon With Jaime It s the same thing people judging brothers and sisters or even worse children for their parents mistakes It s definitely going to be a strain early on the season But Jon lEads by example Jon pardoned ned umber and alys karstrark despite their parents crimes So I expect there to be drama but I think they ll see the light If Jon had taken off alys karstarjs head andned umber head then the north and bronze yohn would be like even you know that poisoned blood is a disease And it need s to be purged You re the mad king s grandson How can we trust you How do we know you won t go mad eventually just like he did But nope Jon believes that everyone is an individual There are good apples and bad apples in the freefolk Good apple and bad apples in those south of the wall Good apples and bad apples within each family And because of that he did not blame children for their parents crimes He basically told the world that you should only judge someone based on their own choices and actions He led by example And they re gonna do the same to him They won t see him as aerys grandson Or rhaegar and lyannas child or even as neds child He s his own man Jon snow I don t expect a name change Cause history is lost over time If he change his bame children hundreds of years from now would remember him And strive to be like him But they d remember him as the mystical targaryen A noble born But he s not Technically he is but the past is written He was treated as a bastard his entire life So that makes him a bastard And the world will remember what that fucker I mean the world will remember what thar bastard did	2018-12-01T21:27:12.000Z	Reply	Lha4bs0TjG0	The Hound s Death explained Game of Thrones Season
Let me take a step back tho My response wasn t really true I m a very laid back dude And a real nerdy dude who loves this story So when analyzing right now its easy to say id rather not see him bc it doesn t really make sense But in truth I m more laid back than nerdy So if I saw him in s I would yell in a good way and smile ear to ear And I wouldn t even waste time thinking about why it doesn t make sense Cause it is was it is I would just rol with it and love it lol Here s a similar example of a way I already do it So we saw dayne die in the show not in the books And it would be soooo cool if qhorin was dayne in the books and mance was rhaegar But ned told bran in the books that he wouldn t be alive if not for howland So most likely dayne died in the books too If qhorin is not dayne in the books then the mance is rhaegar theory could still work but it loses some of it s appeal So here I am starting to wonder if it s even true in the books And I know for sure qhorin isn t dayne in the show Yet I see him as dayne in the show regardless Applying fan line item veto power Blocking out his death scene and seeing him as dayne bc that s how the story lives inside my head Not sure if that makes sense Basically I wouldn t over analyze it if syrio showed up Id block out the fact thar he ditched arya and I d just embrace him with a smile One last thing so my favorite author brandon sanderson He once said that his books aren t done with his first draft Not done after he makes the editors changes or when it hits bookshelves His stories are only complete once they come to life inside people s head And he encourages people to use line item veto power Because the story isn t his It s the readers story and he applies line item veto to books he reads from other authors I think that s a cool philosophy	2018-12-01T21:12:40.000Z	Reply	Lha4bs0TjG0	The Hound s Death explained Game of Thrones Season

Definitely not in the books Cause let s say he survived jaqen ditches a year old girl in the middle of wartorn lands Surround my armies and outlaws I would hate to think syrio wasn t really her friend and didn t care about her In the show it d be okay But it still wouldnt make much sense because the scene is about learning the true seeing Syrio tells her Then trant shows up Syrio applies the true seeng and stops arya from going over to trant And then trant splits syrios sword in two at which point arya applies the lesson and runs Actually that s fine As long as he loses it makes sense And that could explain why jaqen is in the dungeons But he still ditches her A little girl So actually I d be against it cause it would change my view of syrio Instead of a father figure who loved her it would mean he s just a heartless dude who pretended to like her But really didn t care Does that make sense	2018-12-01T20:38:23.000Z	Reply	Lha4bs0TjG0	The Hound s Death explained Game of Thrones Season

Emergency Awesome What if winterfell has the same magic as the wall so the dead can t get in the gates Bran the builder did build the wall and winterfell and since it was his castle then why would he have not implemented this magic	2018-08-20T10:11:24.000Z	Reply	DhRDOo6qsPc	Game Of Thrones Season Truth About Night King and Viserion Revealed
One thing you missed is that the Ice Dragon or White Viserion would now have the abilities of the White Walkers and not of the Wights This means that if White Viscerion would happen to breath blue flame onto the Stark Lannister armies then potentially he could turn all of them instantly into Wights and he wouldn t even need the presence of the Night King either Essentially what could happen is that they could split the Dead Army into three units Coming firstly from the West is White Viscerion which could cripple Westeros army Whereas the Night King and his horseman would come next from the East short route and they would flank the Westeros army during the time of confusion Then the main army can come walking slowly directly from the North consisting of all the wights This could flank the Westeros Army and dwindle any chances And it all hinges on the one single detail Viscerion is a White Walker and not a reanimated wight	2018-08-19T16:05:31.000Z	Reply	DhRDOo6qsPc	Game Of Thrones Season Truth About Night King and Viserion Revealed

How dumb do you have to be to believe the one picture D D decided to leak themselves as misdirection You guys are making it too easy for them All they had to do was leak one carefully orchestrated spoiler just as they said they would There were no multiple endings shot just a few snaps to throw viewers off and everyone since has been raving of Tyrion s betrayal and all kinds of nonsense cuz they couldn t make sense of a second meeting between Cersei and Jon They are right in not being able to make sense of it cuz it s not happening on the show It was simply taken and leaked so all the GoT tards out there could start reaching with their absurd theories and the one that stuck was Tyrion s betrayal and sending Jon to KL If it s coming from the official source don t believe it If they aren t allowed to snap even their boots while shooting how do you think this snap of Cersei and Jon came to be I ll tell you why cuz the makers not only allowed it but orchestrated it so that you all can behave like human dominos with your theories and Tyrion s betrayal or Jon s meeting with Cersei Let me break it to ya all there will be no second meeting Jon Tyrion or Dany do not meet or come face to face with Cersei again in the remaining story even Jaime doesn t Jon is resurrected the second time through a ritual Dany performs or is part of north of the wall Do you people even hear yourselves Dany burns all of KL cuz she is MK s daughter mind numbingly stupid and simple explanation for imagined crap All are nothing like their fathers Jon cuz he is more like Ned and didn t ever know his father Tyrion is not cruel or ruthless like Tywin and far more intelligent Dany is nothing like MK or she would have already been queen of ashes ending the story seasons ago Ser Hunts I m starting to suspect you are actually getting some kind of commission from D D for promoting their smokescreen tactics Get over this photo of Jon in KL Had they leaked a photo of Dany with Cersei in KL you guys would have come up with theories of Dany s betrayal Do not let a stupid lil snap dictate the outcome of the story Question its authenticity purpose and smell the curry FFS Tyrion will be one of the few survivors on this show and you can take that to the iron bank Jon will not be brought back a second time Makes mockery out of a hero and protagonist Do you really think it will leave any kind of impact from a viewers POV watching the same repetitive resurrection Oh Jon dead again oh no Jon s alive again Jon will die and live forever Stop just stop It s embarrassing	2018-11-20T17:15:53.000Z	Comment	42qzC-Z_TBA	'LEAKED' End Game Battle!

To answer your question about Sansa getting captured Yes I can see it That is the sort of drama we have come to expect from this show Also it would be another way that Jamie s act of goodwill will backfire on him Hey here s a good twist The soldiers who recognize her and capture her are the same ones that Arya met in the woods and she spared them that day	2018-11-19T04:21:59.000Z	Reply	42qzC-Z_TBA	LEAKED End Game Battle Game Of Thrones Season Leaked Scenes

I ve read much better predictions then this one It makes no sense and all over the place I doubt anyone will be able to escape when dead people are surrounding WF What makes sense Jamie s foreshadowing If the dead win they march South and kill us all If the North wins and knows we have betrayed them they march South and kills us all Cercei said to let them kill each other and they will deal with whoever was left The North will find a way and carry out a plan to destroy the NK and his army episode will fall with him Regroup then will march South to battle it out with Cercei episode Maybe Jon is there to give Cersei the opportunity to leave as Ned did We ve already seen leaked pictures of KL damaged by dragon fire	2018-11-18T23:44:18.000Z	Reply	42qzC-Z_TBA	LEAKED End Game Battle Game Of Thrones Season Leaked Scenes

Hobodeluxe Miguel Sapochnik is directing episodes and he just finished filming a day or so after Arya Because it s Sapochnik Maisie W most likely had to continue battle scenes with extras It has been foreshadowed that she and Gendry could end up together It would be nice to see her character chill out and become the one thing she didn t want to be a Lady Ned did foreshadow that she would marry a Lord and her sons would be Knights	2018-07-14T16:30:01.000Z	Reply	UNhJbQ3F0hI	Game Of Thrones Season Arya Stark Finale Teaser Explained
Arya is definitely trolling you why in the world would she give away a clue like that especially since they have a non disclosure clause in their contracts the truth is that the real Last woman standing will be Cersei She is always two steps ahead of everybody and has Qyburn making her another Army consisting of the undead white walkers Do you all remember When Jon Snow and his crew brought half of a White Walker and everybody was scared except qyburn did you see how his eyes lit up yep She s going to have him bring Joffrey back and use that already evil little prick into and Undead evil bigger prick to throw everybody off guard and use him to kill Sansa and take advantage of that and use it to kill off a few enemies	2018-07-14T11:13:17.000Z	Reply	UNhJbQ3F0hI	Game Of Thrones Season Arya Stark Finale Teaser Explained

I think the things you cite provide context and subtext and even some clues to greater understanding of the overall plot but I think it s simpler Basic yet surprising My own theory goes something like this The coming war is going to be disastrous for everyone south of the wall As dragonglass and fire and valerian steel are used to kill the army of the dead the southern army will never be able to get ahead Limited manpower meaning a finite of fighters is juxtaposed against the army of the dead s ever increasing numbers as casualties mount And in spite of Jon Snow and company s heroics and Dany s remaining dragons the tide slowly inexorably turns against them Jon will be lost Dany will be lost Arya dead Jamie and Cersei dead The southern armies practically annihilated UNTIL when all seems lost we see the walking dead corpse of Hodor standing not far behind the Night King And at that moment when all seems lost and the Night King is about to receive the cup of victory and the eminent death of all mankind someone Arya Bronn shoots a weir wood arrow at the Night King All seems lost until Bran worgs into the walking dead corpse of Hodor and stabs him with the fallen arrow thereby destroying the Night King and all of his army Evil as we have known it has left the Kingdoms except the evil that lives in the hearts of men that will never go away so of course there will still be theiving and killing but mostly we ll enter into the most peaceful and prosperous times in history And who will be left Tyrion will rule as regent until Jon Snow and Dany s baby grows up with Bronn and Pod by his side And sure Tyrion will grumble that Yara s Iron Island people are still ravaging and the masters of Slaver s Bay are still slaving etc But he ll resign himself that this is the way of the world as it s been for thousands of years And even a just ruler a ruler who loves playing the game like himself can t expect to change things overnight So no need to fret and worry too much He has a kingdom to run in the stead of Jon Dany s baby And there s wine to be drunk And whores to fuck And stories to tell with his friends Bronn and Pod And far away from King s Landing we see lady knight Brienne and former wildling Tormond start a fledgling and frustrating and funny relationship We see Sansa as lady of Winterfell and Queen if the North We see Yara as Queen of the Iron Islands We see young lady Mormont as Queen of Bear Island And we see Sandor Cleghane finally living in peace never having to pick up his sword again That s how I see it	2018-11-27T23:23:05.000Z	Comment	-kRbRiamxDM	Game of Thrones season 8.

I saw no to Gendry and Sansa and Yes to a love triangle between Arya Daario and Gendry My reasoning being is that I feel Arya and Gendry has more weight and setup for it then for that of Gendry and Sansa and I think Arya and Gendry make a better pairing But the reason I would throw Daario into the mix and make a love triangle between Arya Daario and Gendry is not only would it make a good parallel between Dany Daario and Jorah but also Arya and Daario are pretty similar as well They are both wildcards like with Gendry they a both good at killing they both know what it s like to suffer and go through life harshly and they ve both been in Essos in there lives Not to mention a love triangle with Arya Daario and Gendry would create a lot of good drama I feel Which is why I say yes to A Arya Daario and Gendry love triangle and no to Gendry and Sansa	2018-11-27T19:57:11.000Z	Reply	-kRbRiamxDM	Game of Thrones season Daenerys and Jon s child

I think Naomi Watts is gonna play the part of the daughter of the Lord Stark before he was turned into the Night King from the Children of the forest It would be interesting how John and Daenarys relationship is gonna carry out due to him being her brother Rhaegar son I think due to that night on the ship she will become pregnant and that child will be born and be the future for the Targarians I would like to see Lady Brienn of Tarf and the wildling Tormund hook up I would like to see Cercei become one of the dead and her killed by her beloved Jamie	2018-11-17T00:04:07.000Z	Comment	_OAstPyQMM0	Game Of Thrones Season 8 Prequel Official Cast Breakdown

Have you considered Tyrion promised Cersei her baby would be next in line I mean he talked about it with Dany and was concerned because she hadn t named an heir That would also explain why he looked upset on the boat Like Jon he knows the witch might have been lying Thus Jon and Dany having a baby would threaten Tyrion s deal with Cersei Thoughts	2018-12-01T07:14:08.000Z	Comment	wT23H1-u_fQ	Cersei Lannister's Biggest Lie? - Game of Thrones Season 8 (End Game Theory)

I m one of the people who subscribes to the circular deaths theory people die the same way they caused other people to die So lots of people are assuming Cersei will die by getting blown up or something spectacular like that But the first death Cersei put in motion was Robert s and he was gored in the stomach by a boar So I would not be at all surprised to see Cersei get stabbed in the guts And if Qyburn is really a Reyne seeking vengeance against the Lannisters which is another theory I like it would be absolute poetic justice if he were the one to do it	2018-11-27T15:19:14.000Z	Comment	wT23H1-u_fQ	Cersei Lannister's Biggest Lie? - Game of Thrones Season 8 (End Game Theory)

No she is pregnant It will be more dramatic when Jamie chokes her to death with his gold hand He will be ending the house of Lanister Tyrion will probably be dead at that point Jamie will be mortally wounded and die in her arms as he wished Martins irony to give the characters what they want but not in the way they expected Screenwriting	2018-11-14T17:28:15.000Z	Comment	wT23H1-u_fQ	Cersei Lannister's Biggest Lie? - Game of Thrones Season 8 (End Game Theory)

The whole series points out the Hounds fear of fire and how he runs from it even at the expense of others lives I don t want him to die but I don t see how he will survive the series I also think he s going to have a poetic death The main thing we know of happening involving fire is Winterfell burning So how poetic if the Hound sacrifices himself to save Sansa who he always protects But it could be anytime in the series so many times there will be fire around I can t wait for him to meet with Arya but I don t see a further plot line for them from that	2018-12-03T02:35:47.000Z	Comment	cMbAd1X2pko	The Hound: Does He Still Serve A Purpose? - Game of Thrones Season 8 (End Game Theory)

What i would like to know why did NK tale down Viserion and not Drogon in this clip at you can see Drogon in the foreground before NK throws the spear yet he goes after a further moving target he could have taken Drogon much easier possibly even killing or injuring Dany and some of the others why go after a more difficult to hit target To me it implies he has plans for them kinda off topic from the subject of the video but it got me thinking when i saw that clip	2018-11-20T02:53:02.000Z	Comment	X08xdqFr56Q	Dragonriders: The Night King Is A Targaryen? - Game of Thrones Season 8 (End Game Theory)
The major difference between Bran Stark and The Night King is even if they both are wargs Bran stark can only warg the living species and the night king wargs the deads That is the main reason the night king is controlling Viserion since it s a completely different type of warging because viserion is DEAD And that is why the targarian theory doesn t apply to Viserion s rider Viserion is DEAD	2018-11-19T07:38:21.000Z	Comment	X08xdqFr56Q	Dragonriders: The Night King Is A Targaryen? - Game of Thrones Season 8 (End Game Theory)

Yeah there is definitely a reason especially since Drogon was literally just sitting right there on the ice and so it would have been easy to throw a spear at him Only thing I can think if he doesn t have a plan is that he simply went after the more dangerous threat first Since Drogon was just sitting there the NK might have felt that Viserion or Rhaegal were bigger threats since they were both still flying overhead and could have caused a lot more damage	2018-11-21T20:52:28.000Z	Reply	X08xdqFr56Q	Dragonriders The Night King Is A Targaryen Game of Thrones Season End Game Theory
I doubt Missandei would be a dragon rider If we are going with more far fetched theories then I think maybe Melisandre could be a dragon rider She has been around for at least years iirc which means she is older than the throne itself She is also from the magical placed called Asshai she practices magic herself and she has an obsession with fire	2018-11-21T20:57:48.000Z	Reply	X08xdqFr56Q	Dragonriders The Night King Is A Targaryen Game of Thrones Season End Game Theory

Was that on the show or just the books If it s only in the books then it might not apply to the show But then again I think the writers have left a lot of stuff out of the show not because they changed things but because they just want to keep things a surprise For example on the show Cersei was never told that she would be killed by the valanqar or however you spell it so a lot of people think maybe that part of the prophecy won t happen on the show However I think the writers left it out on purpose simply because if they had included it then everyone would not only know that she will be killed eventually which ruins the surprise but they would also know that it would be either Jaime or Tyrion This way by not mentioning it on the show they can catch everyone off guard when Jaime suddenly starts strangling her to death or whatever	2018-11-21T21:08:02.000Z	Reply	X08xdqFr56Q	Dragonriders The Night King Is A Targaryen Game of Thrones Season End Game Theory
