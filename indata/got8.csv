The Lannister twins will not die together Jaime has evolved beyond that sort of thinking ever since AFFC And Cersei is delusional I find it odd when theories don t take into account Jaime s character development and why people think Cersei s wishful thinking trumps the actual prophecy that predicts the exact opposite in Jaime s wierwood dream If Jaime dies and it s unclear whether the dream is predicting actual or metaphorical death it will be with Brienne in the arms of the woman he loves	Ugzkgb5RAj76rTsmMZZ4AaABAg	2018-12-08T02:37:15.000Z	Comment	eGR4z9cTQzY	"Game of Thrones Season 8 ""Dragonstone"" Teaser Explained"

Weiss and Benioff haven t demonstrated that they re that good at the subtler human drama that Martin is good at since once they ran out of books it became much faster and more action oriented with fewer bittersweet surprises and hard choices It seems more likely to me that it is going to be less complicated and more or less focused on the straight up fantasy war with really broad drama Which will probably be fun the show is overall not as good as the books but still not bad Just different It s basically well done fan fiction a bit more predictable and clunky but charming and works well in its own way	UgxLUdJHoR36mryNHYl4AaABAg	2018-12-08T01:46:18.000Z	Comment	eGR4z9cTQzY	"Game of Thrones Season 8 ""Dragonstone"" Teaser Explained"

If you were a General in Westeros where would be the smartest location to fight the Wight Army In an open field No you would be surrounded The one place you would have a chance is to bottleneck their path so you could concentrate all your power at that bottleneck to keep them in front of you Ice and Fire meet at the Twins on the fork of the Trident thats where the wall of dragonglass forms in the teaser The Trident is wide and Wights cant swim and only one way across a bottleneck the Twins you can see in trailer as plain as day What other battle in history happened at the Trident that had long lasting ramifications on all of Westeros hmmm	Ugwvnb_gxHdlJfmdHSB4AaABAg.8oZkRPWUxI48oZrUh7yrXX	2018-12-07T20:19:18.000Z	Reply	eGR4z9cTQzY	"Game of Thrones Season 8 ""Dragonstone"" Teaser Explained"

Irish Red the hero s win with the main hero and heroine the short guy and that white haired dragon girl I haven t seen the show safe and happy But fans want everything burnt Many fans like some of my friends want all the good people in the show to die and want all the wicked evil shit that woman who kills all her children to live happily ever after Atleast that s what my friends want My gripe with this kind of ending is if you want to end your show with the villains successful why develop the hero s for fucking episodes You could have ended the show in or seasons itself if you wanted evil to win The problem I have with these high and mighty shit shows like game of thrones is that they try to become so real that they eventually forget their fantasy aspect And that kind of bums me out You can have serious story with serious well written characters with themes and morality but don t try to be or pride yourself to be real and mature when you are a goddamn fantasy show	UgzUJlJ5knyZXwhbnPJ4AaABAg.8oXedS3DvOl8oY652tQKL1	2018-12-07T03:57:07.000Z	Reply	zvdOaAAJQjc	GAME OF THRONES Season 8 Official Trailer Teaser (2019) GOT S08 HD

It looks to me like ice and fire meet in and around the Neck perhaps just a stone s throw from the Trident That would fit with theories based on Dany s dreams in the book A lot of people the black they create looks like an obsidian wall I know that s what Rawst has said so maybe they do end up having to build another Wall but in the Neck	Ugw53hTsEune-I4gpON4AaABAg	2018-12-07T22:46:13.000Z	Comment	WjhmWbwoMYs	Game of Thrones | Season 8 | Official HBO Teaser Reaction / Review!

Maybe a new wall made of dragonglass obsidian is built as a way to make sure humans and the white walkers stay on their respective sides of the border Your analysis of a the new wall meaning that the white walkers and humanity will clash again does reflect our own history which GRRM is a fan off take World War everyone thought at the time that it would be the last war because no one would want to risk so many dead and so much destruction ever again and yet less than years later it happens again Top it off with winter coming and a lack of food for thousands or more and it may not be an actual long night but a figurative one where harsh times set in making it a fight just to survive and it matters little whose ever ass polishes the iron throne as everyone will be effected	UgyyqunI8R3jYJ63JRt4AaABAg	2018-12-07T23:33:15.000Z	Comment	W18PugvstOI	Teaser Trailer Breakdown: GAME OF THRONES SEASON 8

I believe the Night King will stop over by the Isle of Faces if you look closely in the teaser you ll see the ice and fire meeting between in the isle of faces whats in isle of faces thats where the children of the forest carved all the weirwood trees Also the pact or peace treaty between the children and the first men The night king is possibly going to destroy the God s Eye like he did with the three eye raven and the children That is also the place in the book where meera told the story to bran about the knight of the laughing tree	Ugyj6o0wZ9PgsYO-Sbd4AaABAg	2018-12-07T22:01:44.000Z	Comment	W18PugvstOI	Teaser Trailer Breakdown: GAME OF THRONES SEASON 8

I ve seen quite a few of these teaser trailers so hopefully no copyright issues for you I kind of feel the ice and fire is a bit of symbolism showing the NK moving down and the living moving up towards the Gods Eye from Kings Landing It s quite possible that the freezing direwolf and dragon are attacks on Winterfell and Dragonstone Now what gets me is the fire begins at the Lion meaning there will be a Dany Cersei battle at Kings Landing	Ugw1idwMNsHjpGXcdux4AaABAg	2018-12-07T01:55:28.000Z	Comment	al_Zlgnny8U	What CLUES did the Game of Thrones Season 8 Official Tease Dragonstone give us?

I think every GOT YouTuber analyzes the show according to who they are his or her own life story or song For example it seems to me that bridge is a very kind loving and giving person who truly seems to care about people So when he analyzes GOTs he sees a beautiful but tragic story that begins and ends with children the story or song of life I know my children are the reason I am alive They are my purpose I never felt such absolute joy or pain until I had them But maybe that s the point I don t think you can have absolute joy without heartbreaking pain How could you know how wonderful something is if you never had gut wrenching pain to compare it to There just needs to be a balance sort of like the struggle or song of between fire and ice I don t know GRRM but from what I ve read he seems very different than bridge I don t mean that in any bad way I just don t know if GRRM s life experiences would lead him to the same conclusions as bridge I would love it if bridge was correct but everyone is different Either way I can t wait to see the show and I can t wait to see bridge s next video Sorry this was so long	Ugw5V9iCXdk-scTdhmh4AaABAg	2018-12-07T23:05:23.000Z	Comment	al_Zlgnny8U	What CLUES did the Game of Thrones Season 8 Official Tease Dragonstone give us?

Ok I haven t read the books so bear with me please Red Blue Purple I just saw this on WoTW The names of the Forks of the Trident foreshadow the conflict itself The Red Blue and Green Forks are the three branches of the river Red being fire blue being ice green being life The Trident splits between these three choices and concepts and as does fate itself We know there is an abundance of Dragonglass at Dragonstone What else do we know That the CoTF were there it s an island WWs were there and men with dragons have been there What do we know about the Trident It s actually three rivers Red Blue Green The Red and Blue meet first then meet up with the Green This river exits into the Narrow Sea What is in the Narrow Sea Dragonstone Let s suppose the CoTF created Dragonglass as a way to fight the WW before they joined up They had three magical waters right there at Dragonstone Now to the teaser trailer Where do we see Ice Fire clash Conveniently at both the Trident and the location of the God s Eye where it s possible the last of the CoTF could be chilling out on the Isle Of Faces The trailer seems to show Dragonglass forming This would be a good way to make that come about As for Stannis s account it is possible that either he saw blue somehow blue and red didn t mix with the green or he was misremembering as I m told by readers this is common by main POV characters Anyway just wanted to share Also I think Jaime will survive then he will go on to become king Because what is a king to a country A father Who out of everyone has always put the people of his country first while acting in their professional duties Jaime Not even Jon can say that Not Tyrion The only other person who always acted for the good of the country was the one person we associate as the father of the show Ned No Jaime won t die He will kill Cersei for the good of the realm He will finally be hailed by the people as the hero he is Well not LOTR style but no one will call him king slayer anymore Also Hammer Of The Waters	Ugx-P4OI8WvatACyqet4AaABAg	2018-12-07T19:14:06.000Z	Comment	al_Zlgnny8U	What CLUES did the Game of Thrones Season 8 Official Tease Dragonstone give us?

I noticed that trickle of blood running into the cotf hand from the human arm in that official image of the pact with the handshake I believe brandon the builder learned how to use the cotf magic within his own blood after this pact He then proceeded to construct four structures the crypts of winterfell storms end the hightower and the wall Based on sigils of said locations and house words he may have fused his blood into the stone of these locations Is it possible that each location is a prison of sorts the wall against ice the hightower against fire storms end against the fury of the storm god kraken and the crypt containing the last greenseer of the cotf who reached out to bran through bloodravens visage and who may have escaped by tricking bran into taking a demon crow so he could skinchange it and escape within bran nullifying the blood stone warding Wrap reynolds out	Ugw1idwMNsHjpGXcdux4AaABAg.8oXtA03BTiY8oYl33v0rQj	2018-12-07T10:03:51.000Z	Reply	al_Zlgnny8U	What CLUES did the Game of Thrones Season 8 Official Tease Dragonstone give us?
I think that the freezing wolf and dragon means Jon and Dany will loose Winterfell The burning lion pay attention to the details the fire spreads just like wild fire might mean that the Lannisters will battle the Night King using wild fire I know that it is very popular the theory where the Night King will be stopped at Winterfell but this is a war between the living and the dead It makes sense that the Lannisters should also face the army of the dead They are the only ones who didn t feel the strength of this army I am all for the Night King taking down Winterfell and King s Landing and an alliance between Jon Danny and Jamie Cercei should die at the hands of the Night King will stop the Night King and send the army back north	Ugw1idwMNsHjpGXcdux4AaABAg.8oXtA03BTiY8oYJx4UXUXE	2018-12-07T05:58:14.000Z	Reply	al_Zlgnny8U	What CLUES did the Game of Thrones Season 8 Official Tease Dragonstone give us?

Could it just be showing what we already know mainly from season The mist crawling over the wolf demo of how NK has only affected House Stark so far the north in general Mist overtakes the dragon demo of how NK then touched House Targaryen by taking Viserion Sudden switch from the mist to fire crawling over stag reminder of Targaryen kicked butt against House Lannister in the Field Of Fire Fire meeting Ice in season which if I am right tells us nothing new as we are already aware this is what is coming However season is still over mos away theatre movies don t have real trailers til around mos bf releases so this is nothing unusual is fine by me Finally the teaser shows how Ice Fire together forms Obsidian rock dragon glass the only part that may contain some hidden clue about the new season But to me the birth of new dragonstone reminds me how Dany will most likely have to cool her life s desire to rule over the Kingdoms plus of course all the many other sacrifices which we will see given if our heroes want to attain the greater good thru the Great War to come If this is silly as I am still somewhat of a newbie fan yrs old forgive my ignorance But I am pretty sure we shouldn t read too much into anything yet as the producers are probably reiterating what we already know are desperately awaiting It s most likely more of a viably smart commercial move by HBO for rekindling the flames of the Games hey that rhymes to awaken viewers who are not as dedicated as we are here After all it is a very risky thing even for a series as popular as GOT to make the average devotee wait this long for a conclusion	Ugy7lemAu91a_H-nnL14AaABAg	2018-12-07T19:22:25.000Z	Comment	kj5XgkfS6ZA	Game of Thrones Season 8 Episode Outline - Game of Thrones Season 8 (Spoilers)

Peytr Baelish said something very important when he was manipulating Sansa in S he said everything that happens now will be something she has seen before And I think that also goes for us fans as well GRRM is a history fanatic GOT is based on The War of The Roses between the Lancaster s and York s I m sound nutty right now but I think that if we want to know who will take the Iron Throne in the end we need to look into the history books You did a video a while back about Sansa s fate And I do think that Sansa will be the one to take the Iron Throne just like Elizabeth I did Sansa Elizabeth I red hair pale skin Had a brutal life after her father died and her mothers head was chopped off Lady Katlyn had her throat cut deep at the Red Wedding Elizabeth was tortured and tormented for most of her childhood just like Sansa the Tudor s inherited the English throne all because of a marriage to a low level Lancaster Sansa is a Lanister by marriage If Cersei Jaime and Tyrion die in S as we all think Sansa will be the only remaining Lanister Just like Elizabeth I Sansa will not get married Cersei a splash of Mary I aka Bloody Mary along with a phantom pregnancy Sansa is the young Queen everyone will love Mary I hated Elizabeth because she was younger and beautiful and beloved I don t think Cersei will be killed anyone I think her fate is worse I think she will die of an illness Roting and smelling until her last breathe We cannot under estimate Sansa she has a strong survival instinct she understands people and motives now and she also understands politics and diplomacy Of all the Stark children who tried to make it to The Wall to Jon for safety Sansa was the only one to make it to Jon She is the one who convinced Jon to take back Winterfel She has a strong sense of who she is and what belongs to her and she is not afraid to make hard decisions	UgzuGWByKM439szSMsF4AaABAg	2018-12-07T15:32:55.000Z	Comment	kj5XgkfS6ZA	Game of Thrones Season 8 Episode Outline - Game of Thrones Season 8 (Spoilers)

I forgot to say something and I hope im wrong what if season isnt that good for this reason I bet a million dollars when the series ends it will probably be no longer than days when grrm gives us a date for winds of winter even though the show runners know the ending mattin intends its not going to ne anything like what happens in the books I believe he has finished TWOW and is probably working on ADOS he s just waiting for the show to end I think if they would ve done the lady stoneheart and a proper dorn plot and introduced euron earlier the show wouldn t be ending so fast its like they found out the ending and rushed to get there thats why martin left the show however this has to be a kick ass satisfying end to the show lets hope	UgwLF8yLmvZeL50bQgV4AaABAg	2018-12-07T02:14:43.000Z	Comment	HCng5rF-wYs	Game of Thrones Season 8 Teaser Breakdown | Dragonstone
I think your right about the wolf getting covered in ice but the fact that the head isnt enveloped tells me team winterfell will take a tremendous lost jon dany sansa arya etc may have to abandon their seat of power and flee south I get that from the ice wolf because of last season teaser where we see a headed dragon and one of the heads of the dragon collapsed viserion this teaser definitely means something im like you I can not wait they should ve released this season during the winter how cool would it be to binge watch the war of winter while an actual blizzard takes place	UgzixXREl1ddeMyCfUZ4AaABAg	2018-12-07T01:54:32.000Z	Comment	HCng5rF-wYs	Game of Thrones Season 8 Teaser Breakdown | Dragonstone
First King McKay I love your videos Thank you And next it is clear that there will be a ton of action in season which is great and it s time but I personally am hoping that there is still a ton of dialog and character intrigue and interaction That is what I like best about GoT As to the teaser I think it simply represents Daenerys and her army and dragons from the East fire and the white walkers from the North ice thus Fire and Ice and that these two formidable forces will ultimately clash	Ugx9luvDNlcdN6fV5p94AaABAg	2018-12-07T01:53:13.000Z	Comment	HCng5rF-wYs	Game of Thrones Season 8 Teaser Breakdown | Dragonstone
I don t agree with yiur interpretation of the teaser I think the ice and fire just signifies the primary enemies of each of the party s involved in the show The Starks and Targaryen have to mainly fight White walkers while The Lannisters have to fight the fire breathing Dragons or just Targaryens So each element in the teaser represents the main threat to each of houses The Dragon glass is just a hope or a reminder for the weapons they can use to fight there enemy	Ugwm2YzfPsSUmctJkfx4AaABAg	2018-12-07T00:12:24.000Z	Comment	HCng5rF-wYs	Game of Thrones Season 8 Teaser Breakdown | Dragonstone

Tyrion Lannister will fall in love with a dragon like how Donkey fell in love with a dragon at the end of Shrek DON T JUDGE LOVE IS LOVE After this he will have a dragon child which is half human so it can transform at will like Optimus Prime Humans are as cold as ice and Tyrion is actually a Targaryen look into it Eddie Bravo voice the dragon child will be the combination of fire and ice GET IT his dragon child would be a powerful half dragon with a high IQ because my boy is Tyrion is hella smart the child will find a way to win the great war by combining his genius with Tyrion s Remember dragons age fast and they will probably find a spell that helps them age even faster a genius dragon is unstoppable Tyrion will win the game of thrones yall midget haters are gonna hold the biggest L of all time just wait and see trust me my theory is legit i watch and understand Rick and Morty i m a very smart rationalist centrist atheist muslim humanist feminist	Ugy5xO7l8hSfiAnZSml4AaABAg	2018-12-06T23:56:14.000Z	Comment	HCng5rF-wYs	Game of Thrones Season 8 Teaser Breakdown | Dragonstone

This can be taken further as the open reveal that fire and ice are both destructive extremes in the story and a hint that Daenerys will turn into as much a villain as the Night King at least for those who haven t seen it this way all along I guess we ll see Cersei and Sansa unite against both probably gaining Jon to their cause	Ugwm2YzfPsSUmctJkfx4AaABAg.8oXhN5x1-2D8oYMht-vCeC	2018-12-07T06:22:22.000Z	Reply	HCng5rF-wYs	Game of Thrones Season 8 Teaser Breakdown | Dragonstone

SarahScarlett showing green fire would have given it away if Cersei does end up using it However I would be really disappointed in the series if Jon and Dany actually defeat the walkers and then the rest of the season is them turning around and crushing Cersei The plot needs to be way more complex than that As nice as it would be to see the living triumph and Jon and Dany can have a baby who rules the seven kingdoms I think deep down GOT fans are masochists and want to have their souls crushed	UgxCl9Fl_FZbKuUGqzh4AaABAg.8oXf0EP8hm48oYcnuVdXGQ	2018-12-07T08:51:44.000Z	Reply	HCng5rF-wYs	Game of Thrones Season 8 Teaser Breakdown | Dragonstone

King Mckay maybe he kills her when he realizes that she plans to join the white walkers Like when Stannis tried to take King s Landing and Cersei said that if Stannis could be seduced she would yield to him Maybe she ll convince the walkers to agree to some sort of arrangement	UgxCl9Fl_FZbKuUGqzh4AaABAg.8oXf0EP8hm48oXsFsty0sl	2018-12-07T01:47:32.000Z	Reply	HCng5rF-wYs	Game of Thrones Season 8 Teaser Breakdown | Dragonstone

There s foreshadowing in past episodes that Daenerys will attack King s Landing and probably set off the wildfire caches still hidden in the city It wouldn t be surprising if Cersei also thought to booby trap the city whether it s to be a weapon against Daenerys or maybe Cersei channeling Aerys deciding she just doesn t give a damn anymore and has the city blown up It would also be poetically ironic if Daenerys attacked and then inadvertently destroyed the city all because she s been fixated on getting the throne and taking back her family s legacy	UgxCl9Fl_FZbKuUGqzh4AaABAg.8oXf0EP8hm48oXpgkA2TKt	2018-12-07T01:25:07.000Z	Reply	HCng5rF-wYs	Game of Thrones Season 8 Teaser Breakdown | Dragonstone

Well now Tywin is known for more than just butchery He participated in the War of the Ninepenny Kings where he and his brothers Kevan and Tygett won much glory for themselves Tywin is also known for becoming the youngest Hand of the King in history to the Mad King Aerys and for making the realm prosper for commoners and nobles alike for years Not only that he kept the Kingdoms from collapsing by the blunders and foolishness of the Mad King if it hadn t been for Tywin bailing the Crown out of debt from the Iron Bank out of his own pocket Westeros would ve been in deep shit before the show even started The Lannistes have at numerous occasions been forced to repair the realm from Targaryen instigated conflicts with their own money the Dance of Dragons for example And I don t know what evidence you speak of concerning Tytos death he died of heart failure when climbing the steps to his mistress chamber at Casterly Rock Tywin was at King s Landing when that happened Sure the Rains of Castamere is his greatest accomplishment and the reason for his fearsome reputation but it is far from everything that makes up his character By the way two errors in the video Tywin s grandfather was Gerold Lannister not Gerard and it was Roger Reyne not Rogar Reyne	UgyvbU4L7YmK04Ujsad4AaABAg	2018-12-07T20:53:48.000Z	Comment	EK4uZWGkzqQ	The Lannister Curse | History Repeats | Tywin's Legacy | Game of Thrones Season 8

My theory Since there s speculation that the prophecy Lord varys heard was that for the battle to end the true king of the iron throne should be sitting on it is that John will not accept the seat then dany will seat on it Then the battle will be lost and everyone becomes a dead ice guy Then the dragons will in the end kill all the ice men and they rule the world The dragons At this point I m keeping my expectations to the very minimum You know Incase the producers decide to kill everyone I like like Jon dany sansa though I think arya could escape	UgzcuAYoXtycEarRzQ14AaABAg	2018-11-29T17:31:02.000Z	Comment	v5gsVRxzzI4	Game of Thrones Season 8 Teaser Trailer #1 (2019) Emilia Clarke, Kit Harington / Trailer Concept

Lol sorry but Peter Dinklage isn t going to say his character will die before the season drops Especially not bluntly like that quote you listed Lol I think its going to come down to him having to choose between his family jamie cersei and maybe baby or lied about fake baby and the people who gave him the respect he deserved and wanted You can see at the end of season that he isn t just being curious There is something more to it Whether it be a plot to kill one or the other D or J or whether just trying to keep penises out of vaginas but def not just noising around for the info Tyrion has always said that he loves his family deeply In season he says he d never take anyone over their family Granted this was before the events of GoT played out the way they did So we ll see where that goes Tyrion is clevel but he has never been known to be a liar tho I m on ambein right now so I maybe forgetting stuff if someone feels like refreshing my mind But yea I wouldn t be surprised if he took a dagger in to Dany s heart after the upcoming battle for Winterfell or even plotted with Jamie to kill his sister I think they d both for that too Thoughts	UgxMmDvYoWh0NYKjJ2l4AaABAg	2018-11-11T08:29:21.000Z	Comment	WKyVnbrDlkE	Game Of Thrones Season 8 Tyrion and Ned Stark Special Episode Explained

I think the best twist right now the most unexpected would be for Jon and Daenerys to realise they have to bend the knee to Cercei in order to win against the Night King It makes sense strategically though as Cercei is so selfish Then Cercei can have a redemption arc where she realises the two of them aren t so bad before dying or she dies tries to decieve them again before dying and realising her stupidity	UgxwHO2XkqFwZy8uasd4AaABAg	2018-12-05T18:56:13.000Z	Comment	_NCIlWLdLg0	Battle Of Winterfell CONFIRMED!

Lisab Sau Yeah we know Cersei won t march south she told Jamie she plans to take back the lands she lost Eg Dragonstone and Casterly Rock It s likely that whoever survives the battle will realize they ve been betrayed and the next episodes will be Cersei Vs whomever wins last epidode will conclude the series Seems like a legit format	UgxZbd1li-FlhEKShlJ4AaABAg.8oSK9YrZj2f8oVfkBQsZe7	2018-12-06T05:19:43.000Z	Reply	_NCIlWLdLg0	Battle Of Winterfell CONFIRMED!

I predicted the battle with the NK would be in episode a year ago and the actor who plays TNK confirmed it So where s Eric and Mark lol Also I predicated that the battle with Cersei would happen in episode We will have to wait and see about that one It has never made sense why Cersei would send her army up North while leaving herself vulnerable to an attack Jamie specifically told her If the army of the dead wins they march South and kill us all If the North wins and they realize we ve betrayed them they march south and kill us all There s two battles here Whoever wins the battle in the North will march South and battle Cersei who will refuse to abdicate the throne It s hard to imagine Tyrion betraying Dany after everything she has done for him However I have seen the camera focus on his expressions when Drogon was being used to execute Dany s enemies or protect her Perhaps he may be involved with killing Drogon instead of using wildfire against KL Just a thought	UgxZbd1li-FlhEKShlJ4AaABAg.8oSK9YrZj2f8oVUMftEaf4	2018-12-06T03:31:31.000Z	Reply	_NCIlWLdLg0	Battle Of Winterfell CONFIRMED!

Do you even know what LEAKED SCENES means It s not some fan theory that you think of in your head or hear from someone or read about somewhere you decide to popularize or something heard from the cast or crew on the show simply confirms what we already know A leaked scene is ACTUAL FOOTAGE from an episode or episodes on the show that unintentionally spreads throughout the internet perhaps eventually goes viral or something along those lines So next time when you make a video the content doesn t exactly match the description above then don t call it a LEAKED SCENE cause it s not	UgxZbd1li-FlhEKShlJ4AaABAg.8oSK9YrZj2f8oSQ5o5y8_Z	2018-12-04T22:56:33.000Z	Reply	_NCIlWLdLg0	Battle Of Winterfell CONFIRMED!

I think what will happen is that one good guy from each of the major houses survives I think there will be a lot of sacrificing going on that makes that happen Theon dies to save his sister Jaime dies to save Tyrion and Arya dies to save Sansa But I think the big reveal is something that was hinted at once you kill a higher up undead all the undead under that leader dies instantly I think it will come out that Jon was actually raised by the Lich King and the last episode will be where Jon kills him in front of everyone knowing that he will die also as soon as the lich king dies I think the last scene will be when Dany breaks the wheel by creating a democracy or some type of council rule where you would have Tyrian Sam Yara Sansa Dany and Gendry leading as a group I really think when Dany said she wants to break the wheel it meant she doesn t want it to be a monarchy anymore	Ugz8lQjWQ4Nr_7igE2F4AaABAg	2018-11-29T00:24:13.000Z	Comment	Cc4OMnlHIeU	Game Of Thrones Season 8: Predicting The Fate Of Every Character

Two season questions to think about Cersei s going down so how is the with child problem handled no hero is going to take out or cause a miscarriage of a unborn child Sansa s going to stay in Winterfell and carry on the Stark name so she cannot also marry Gendry and carry on that families name So who is in line to marry Sansa who is around her age and is not a eunuch Jaime is out for age impurity and he probably will not live Maybe the remaining wilding old but not real old kind of odd Jorah and Bronn seem a bit old Maybe a new or promoted character	UgxIt9DY8L3CD5nDdfV4AaABAg	2018-12-06T20:46:57.000Z	Comment	KZxRvfo8vnY	Why Did They Bring Gendry Back? - Game of Thrones Season 8 (End Game Theory)
Fan theory guess they need him to forge a new sword i think to defeat the knight king they need a sword made of steel and whatever the white walker weapons are made of Sam and Bran will help figure this out it looks like and i think it s the opposite of dragon glass and dragon glass or valyrian steel combo of dragon glass and steel it wont work because the knight king was created with dragon glass and he would need to be defeated with his own weapon or combo of ice glass and steel Gendry will be forming one for Jon and he will pull this sword from the burning fire possibly created by the ice dragon when it attacks and sets Winterfell on fire this sword helps them escape the knight king will take over westeros and push everyone to Dragonstone or an Island to regroup Cerici wont leave and is defeated and turned into the knight Queen but not until she blows up the city with wildfire trying to win but only weakens the knight king I think the long night has to come before the Dawn and summer can come back possibly a time jump with Jon being older with his son and daughter older as well and are the three heads of the dragon and are returning to westeros to reclaim it Dany dies giving child birth to twins Only a fans theory guess how it might end and what Gendry is needed for	UgwtQNlfbRkpFUo0o4N4AaABAg	2018-12-06T19:04:18.000Z	Comment	KZxRvfo8vnY	Why Did They Bring Gendry Back? - Game of Thrones Season 8 (End Game Theory)

I think Gendry is the only legitimate child of Robert and Cersei In season one Cersei tells a story about her st born son who had black hair She says he died but she lies all the time Later on when Ned starts investigating he finds Gendry and asks about his mother Gendry tells him she was blond and that she died Cersei despised Robert but she loves her children Love could make her incapable of killing a legitimate child of Robert s but hate could make her capable of abandoning that child If Gendry is their legitimate child and he marries a Stark it would link all four of the great houses Baratheon and Lannister through Gendry s blood Stark Lannister and Baratheon through Gendry and a Stark Marriage Targaryen and Stark through Jon s blood	UgxYbGds8VpidjMY-Gh4AaABAg	2018-12-06T08:23:05.000Z	Comment	KZxRvfo8vnY	Why Did They Bring Gendry Back? - Game of Thrones Season 8 (End Game Theory)

The children created both sides That s the twist Because of the destruction of the Valyrians the doom robert s rebellion Summerhall dance of dragons the ice and fire paradigm is out of control which is why the WW are leaving golden ratio spirals and balance symbolism There are two wheels which are going to be broken The kingdoms AND fire and ice Jon is going to be turned He s the song of fire and ice and will replace the NK but because of his blood it will fuck up the pact Ice will become Ice and fire with no opposite I think the Valyrians were created out of the last hero and chums The children wouldn t stop the WW because humans would still be a threat and grow out of control They therefore implemented a balancing act I also think after the long night these firewights left westeros went to the flames and set up the Valyrian freehold Valyrians are just the Fire version of white walkers Like Jon when he was resurrected I also think all characters who were resurrected in the show Berrick Cat and Jon all have blood of those first firewights Danny will die in childbirth leaving the child which will be both Ice and Fire	UgzyMgilQQkdLOR8sJR4AaABAg	2018-11-28T15:56:10.000Z	Comment	J6lLP00MEnM	Night King Ending 'LEAKED' Scene!

Aegon the conqueror was raised at Dragonstone I assume at some point of time he might have entered the cave where Jon mined the Dragonglass and he might have seen the paintings on the wall allegedly made by Children of the forest The paintings the existence of the wall itself and the lore of the past would have convinced him to unite the realm	UgwXli2EJdmMQxebY014AaABAg.8no89FX9e8_8oX1Y_OkzDt	2018-12-06T17:58:13.000Z	Reply	4jKyTaTAl9Y	Game Of Thrones Season 8 - Aegon Targaryen's Secret Jon Snow Plan Explained

I remember reading or hearing somewhere that Daenys the Dreamer saw the fall of Valeria and that Targaryens in general were very interested in prophecies Add to that Rhaegar Targaryen s own premonitions and concerns about prophecy and his marriage to Lyanna I think many of the Targaryens knew something was coming That lead me to believe that Aegon had a premonition about a threat from the North and that was his reason for invading I think he said something about that premonition to Torrhen Stark and the need for unity That is why Torrhen Stark bent the knee to Aegon without a fight and kept his Valyerian Steel Sword	UgwXli2EJdmMQxebY014AaABAg.8no89FX9e8_8npIia_F9yB	2018-11-19T09:02:27.000Z	Reply	4jKyTaTAl9Y	Game Of Thrones Season 8 - Aegon Targaryen's Secret Jon Snow Plan Explained

How dumb do you have to be to believe the one picture D D decided to leak themselves as misdirection You guys are making it too easy for them All they had to do was leak one carefully orchestrated spoiler just as they said they would There were no multiple endings shot just a few snaps to throw viewers off and everyone since has been raving of Tyrion s betrayal and all kinds of nonsense cuz they couldn t make sense of a second meeting between Cersei and Jon They are right in not being able to make sense of it cuz it s not happening on the show It was simply taken and leaked so all the GoT tards out there could start reaching with their absurd theories and the one that stuck was Tyrion s betrayal and sending Jon to KL If it s coming from the official source don t believe it If they aren t allowed to snap even their boots while shooting how do you think this snap of Cersei and Jon came to be I ll tell you why cuz the makers not only allowed it but orchestrated it so that you all can behave like human dominos with your theories and Tyrion s betrayal or Jon s meeting with Cersei Let me break it to ya all there will be no second meeting Jon Tyrion or Dany do not meet or come face to face with Cersei again in the remaining story even Jaime doesn t Jon is resurrected the second time through a ritual Dany performs or is part of north of the wall Do you people even hear yourselves Dany burns all of KL cuz she is MK s daughter mind numbingly stupid and simple explanation for imagined crap All are nothing like their fathers Jon cuz he is more like Ned and didn t ever know his father Tyrion is not cruel or ruthless like Tywin and far more intelligent Dany is nothing like MK or she would have already been queen of ashes ending the story seasons ago Ser Hunts I m starting to suspect you are actually getting some kind of commission from D D for promoting their smokescreen tactics Get over this photo of Jon in KL Had they leaked a photo of Dany with Cersei in KL you guys would have come up with theories of Dany s betrayal Do not let a stupid lil snap dictate the outcome of the story Question its authenticity purpose and smell the curry FFS Tyrion will be one of the few survivors on this show and you can take that to the iron bank Jon will not be brought back a second time Makes mockery out of a hero and protagonist Do you really think it will leave any kind of impact from a viewers POV watching the same repetitive resurrection Oh Jon dead again oh no Jon s alive again Jon will die and live forever Stop just stop It s embarrassing	Ugw6i39VCQempR3XfQN4AaABAg	2018-11-20T17:13:35.000Z	Comment	t2Hy1HkEm7c	'LEAKED' End Game Scene!

I thought the marketing campaign would start after the holidays because without new content the hype would kinda get lost in the Christmas Chaos As soon as everyone winds down boom hype everyone up for GoT Remember the marketing campaign outline for season that leaked and everyone was like any post using the word bittersweet is written by an HBO intern It showed the schedule for when they d release trailers when they d have events how they were going to take advantage of cons and festivals etc Going by that previous schedule they re starting months early But season was also being released in August not April so maybe they really are going to take advantage of the shopping season for their new figurines in the HBO store and try to keep us hyped for the full months That seems like such a long time to be on tenterhooks though	UgxekN2g7mm9YKXl4AN4AaABAg.8ngSJDr24Kv8nl80Dvyvcv	2018-11-17T18:11:55.000Z	Reply	p_czGsDd2rE	Game Of Thrones Season 8 Release Date Trailer Easter Eggs and Winds of Winter

Jamie being the Valonqar would ruin his redemption Besides he only have one hand Most likely it s Euron The problem with the Valonqar prophecy is that it completely contradicts the way George R R Martin treats prophecy It outright tells us what is going to happen So either it s false or it s not the end of her story In the Forsaken chapter Aeron sees a vision of Euron on the Iron Throne with a pale woman at his side I believe that s a reanimated Cersei So far Cersei and Cat s stories seem to mirror each others so Cersei dying then being reanimated makes sense	UgwyG9ZzPmuO2xNvQS94AaABAg	2018-12-06T11:43:24.000Z	Comment	z8hiEpZ4i0I	SEASON 8 Cersei’s Death Confirmed ?! | Game of Thrones
good video But I wonder in book when Jaime falls asleep on the weirwood stump and dreams of being below Casterly Rock he sees Tywin Joffrey and Cersei we know in the show two of these are dead and when Jaime calls to Cersei to stay with him she states to him this is your darkness and his alone so it makes me wonder if they are going to apply this to S and Cersei dies before Jaime I don t think Jaime will be the one to kill Cersei I still think Tyrion will be the one I really hope Jaime lives but I don t expect it	UgwsgO9KKViIm-YuUE54AaABAg	2018-12-05T20:28:52.000Z	Comment	z8hiEpZ4i0I	SEASON 8 Cersei’s Death Confirmed ?! | Game of Thrones

By the wording of the prophecy the Valonquar is someone very important to more than Cersei as it s the only word said in high Valyrian Also the person has two hands and it doesn t say that it s HER little brother but THE Valonquar Arya too obvious Jaime too obvious Tyrion WAY too obvious It s going to be someone not quite that obvious	Ugzd7NYyCgsrLS1rfAt4AaABAg	2018-12-05T02:21:45.000Z	Comment	z8hiEpZ4i0I	SEASON 8 Cersei’s Death Confirmed ?! | Game of Thrones

There is no valonqar Prophecies used to make people act certain ways Summerhall whatever Rhaegar did and Dany s kept them in mind but went with her gut ignored them Cersei was going to be Queen no matter what because of Tywin she broke the prophecy early and that s why she forgot about it until AFFC However Cersei s taken Aerys place pretty much much like Dany has Cersei wins GOT for ignoring prophecy and focusing on herself which after all is said and done MAY be what the prophecy intended It s plausible those who prophesy BR Bran EC prophetic sorts should just shut up instead of trying to change things with prophecies in GRRM s world it makes the CotF EC the bad guys Cersei s winning this and SO is Jon Dany Bran and the trees are going down Arya might try to stick Jon with pointy end hope she fails	UgwC1Nyo0OC97iw2KjV4AaABAg	2018-12-03T04:03:25.000Z	Comment	z8hiEpZ4i0I	SEASON 8 Cersei’s Death Confirmed ?! | Game of Thrones

My money is on Euron The term Valonqar might be gender neutral however the grammar used in the prophecy is not It says the valonqar will wrap HIS hands He is male which passes Daenerys Sansa etc out However Arya could wear a male face Valonqar is the only term in the whole prophecy in Valyrian language so he most likely has ties to Valyria which passes Arya out with or without Jaime s face and also Sandor Clegane Euron had been to Valyria travelled the ruins and owns an armour of Valyrian steel The nd male candidate that comes into question would be Jon Snow who has valyrian blood and is the little brother of Aegon VI and Rhaenys at least in the show there might be a few more persons in the books Euron is Balon Greyjoy s younger brother Strongest hint When Cersei recalls her visit at Maggy the Frog in her dream she wanted to warn the girls but she couldn t talk because she had no tongue anymore AFFC Cersei POV And as we know Euron is infamous for cutting tongues out Im pretty sure Euron will kill Cersei because he wants to become king himself And Im also sure we won t have to wait til the finale for her demise	UgwztWK1Tu4V79HH2bd4AaABAg	2018-12-02T16:59:32.000Z	Comment	z8hiEpZ4i0I	SEASON 8 Cersei’s Death Confirmed ?! | Game of Thrones

I think all this points out to a dance of dragons in the final battle Which is not a surprise with Dany having two dragons and the night king one all this evidence from the EW article really supports this such a thing might seem quite impossible from season perspective where the budget obviously was a lot smaller Plus of course these scenes will be shot indoors after the nights outside in the mud	Ugx13dEdQMwQLX6O2H54AaABAg.8nKP0xj9r498nOSyofWs97	2018-11-08T13:33:19.000Z	Reply	R4ot9ZE-ebI	House Stark of Winterfell: Their True Purpose? - Game of Thrones Season 8 (End Game Theory)
ItcanbegreatI believe he wants his throne back too one thing ppl have been talking about including this channel is the knight king being the king of the st mens son A lot of ppl think bran is the nk but the most believable thing I ve heard is the king sent his son the prince to parlay with the children of the Forrest but they took him hostage turned him to the knight king Why should the nk be any different from the rest of the characters He s just playing the game of thrones as well	Ugx13dEdQMwQLX6O2H54AaABAg.8nKP0xj9r498nNAIaV6z8E	2018-11-08T01:30:53.000Z	Reply	R4ot9ZE-ebI	House Stark of Winterfell: Their True Purpose? - Game of Thrones Season 8 (End Game Theory)
Talking Thrones I ve also heard that they leased the space in Spain where they film the scenes for the dragon pit for weeks This would lead me to believe there will also be quite the battle there as well	Ugx13dEdQMwQLX6O2H54AaABAg.8nKP0xj9r498nMPFjR0JmI	2018-11-07T18:22:19.000Z	Reply	R4ot9ZE-ebI	House Stark of Winterfell: Their True Purpose? - Game of Thrones Season 8 (End Game Theory)

So i have a theaory no one has thought of i dont think I have stayed quiet until now because i was waiting for some actions to come to life I think that the night king will lead his army to winterfell after leaving a trail of destruction through the north When the night king arrives he is met by the starks at full force I beileve the night king will start to lose severe numbers and realize that he needs more whites At this point he will fly his dragon to kings landing where he will turn his army from to because in season when danerys is in kings landing in her vision from the undying like you said the white walker theme song and the roof looks as if a dragons fire had torched it Thats all i have put together so far it might be trash it could make sensce but i have my tinfoil ready let me kno what you think pls	Ugx13dEdQMwQLX6O2H54AaABAg.8nKP0xj9r498nM-DLFTNmC	2018-11-07T14:34:48.000Z	Reply	R4ot9ZE-ebI	House Stark of Winterfell: Their True Purpose? - Game of Thrones Season 8 (End Game Theory)
