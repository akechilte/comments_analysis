ETH is centralized and controlled They have already manipulated their ledger to reverse monetary transactions If you hold ETH you are trusting corporations with your money If you hold BTC you are trusting yourself and no one can take your BTC away from you because it is DECENTRALIZED Corporate shills will never explain the centralization issue You don t need block chain for smart contracts if your platform is centralized Just use a database The true value of bitcoin is that it cannot be tampered with unlike all the other currencies available not just crypto currencies All alt coins will eventually go to because everything they do can be done in immutable fashion on the one true blockchain BITCOIN the people s money	UgwERCZK6Nxt-eahsHB4AaABAg	2018-08-04T14:33:09.000Z	Comment	0UBk1e5qnr4	Ethereum Vs.

berserker The certain conditions referred to in the video are coded into the smart contract It could be a date a block height a winning bid another specific account making a transaction really anything If you wanted them to they could be the estate agent making a transaction to indicate that the house is sold if you want it to be that but it doesn t have to be at all So don t call Aimstone a dirty liar without a full understanding of smart contracts yourself	UgzVgP_FTkc7RLQ7wqV4AaABAg.8bO3z50Mtnz8bOv9z24fzP	2018-01-14T11:31:39.000Z	Reply	d94l-_3B6dM	Ethereum vs Bitcoin | Explained (For Beginners)
You are a dirty liar decentralized apps and smart contracts do not cut out the middle men i mean you said it yourself a smart contract can be programmed to pay out when certain conditions are met But where do these conditions come from The conditions for a smart contract to execute will practically be when the middle men tells it to Example Im selling my house the deed is in the blockchain but it wont change hands until the real estate agent lawyer has given it the green light the smart contract wont know until then it needs the signal from these people or their equivalents first So you basically just added an unnecessary and complicated layer with the smart contract creating an even bigger need for middle men	UgzVgP_FTkc7RLQ7wqV4AaABAg.8bO3z50Mtnz8bOepdzG4Qj	2018-01-14T09:08:55.000Z	Reply	d94l-_3B6dM	Ethereum vs Bitcoin | Explained (For Beginners)

I wanted to invest into btc in and I couldn t do it I got payed from a TV ad I was in I was only young If I invested that I would have over million today I kept that secret for a long time now but my family new from the beginning they re sick AND STILL NOT INVESTING Now I lost my job and have no income But opened an old wallet I had since so you can imagine how happy I was from spare change not worth withdrawing to thousands now I m trading with that wallet money but I am having problems verifying accounts to trade to the new possible bitcoins In other words I could have bought cents a bitcoin Now I can buy cents a ripple which is superior but less anonymous as bitcoin with less publicity Tbh Bitcoin isn t anonymous very much at all but mass psychology has the people thinking it is and investing in it plus obviously to get away from fiat I m currently trying to not make the same mistake I made in I m trying to diversify but I m obviously focusing on ripple Look back at my second paragraph Wish me look wish you guys all the best DJ	UgxmrUWbaT9KFVpJHIF4AaABAg	2017-12-18T23:47:31.000Z	Comment	BSBfuGRvfvw	Bitcoin vs Ethereum: They are NOT the same!

Some practical advice Go to China before the mid autumn festival when the mooncakemania takes hold of this rather populous place Rather than handing out the tin boxes filled with mooncakes that most people don t even like a bit like the Lyons Club Christmas pudding companies just send out vouchers coupons The recipients who don t really want the silly mooncake often sell these vouchers coupons for hard cold cash They can then convert this cash into Ethers or bitcoins or any other currency Read what Silvio Gesell thought about money	UgyaNvO7P6RqfcKgvDp4AaABAg	2017-12-10T04:02:56.000Z	Comment	BSBfuGRvfvw	Bitcoin vs Ethereum: They are NOT the same!

I can see unsolvable problems who ever really understands the technology please answer The ledger is the center of the whole technology This is nothing but a database encrypted by whatever size blocks in case of bitcoin it is Mb The more transactions happen the more the size of this Database grows And remember each participant node or call it miner has to have the whole Ledger in order to participate So am I going to store a Tb file on my laptop in a few years What about years from now Is it going to grow Tb The other big problem is in case of any transaction the miner has to decrypt all blocks back in history because it wanna make sure the bitcoins involved in the transaction are legit therefore the miner traces the history of that bitcoin all the way back to the source when it was originally mined This is defined in the white paper this is how thrust is created Imagine the CPU power needed to decrypt back and force a Tb file for every transaction The CPU power the storage space the network speed needed for bitcoin is ever expanding When it will choak nobody can guess When there will be very few bitcoins left million is the maximum if I remember well who the hell will mine them anymore When more and more miners quit who will provide the CPU power to conduct the transactions I understand this is why they are moving to proof of stake mining but I don t think it will help in this case I tie up bitcoin for months just to be able to mine the next bitcoin which will ever get harder to get Again who is going to provide the CPU power after a certain threshold to keep transactions going My guess when most coins are already mined miners will abandon the bitcoin network and we people will be stuck with our tiny wallets	UgzcJFWBszM0P9Mu4ll4AaABAg	2017-11-16T12:41:16.000Z	Comment	Egp8wNvu6k8	Programmer explains blockchain | Ethereum vs Bitcoin blockchain

From my understanding we will have to start paying the miners to continue mining by attaching fees with each coin transaction we make However what I do not understand is how it expected to continue since the miners will only want to accept the highest paying transactions It seems as if some type of centralized entity will need to regulate either fees or who and how the block chains are mined after all the bitcoin is released	UgzcJFWBszM0P9Mu4ll4AaABAg.8_17ECYbCeO8_jJKG84E9V	2017-12-04T01:52:46.000Z	Reply	Egp8wNvu6k8	Programmer explains blockchain | Ethereum vs Bitcoin blockchain

In general I found his answers to be quite unsatisfying The supposed safety argument of keeping Bitcoin rather than Ether as the value carrying cryptocurrency makes things unnecessarily complicated and achieves the exact opposite by making things less safe And the hashrate thing is matter of time if miners switch to the coin most profitable price reward rate Bitcoin will soon be less safer Oh well	UgxCSn1mc9xHw9F4kkF4AaABAg	2018-02-04T10:51:25.000Z	Comment	qE_E7CWK4i8	Does Ethereum compete against Bitcoin & can they work together? - Andreas M.

I think you are totally right but ultimately it s because he doesn t know the answer like of people in this space My own argument is that Bitcoin might be safer for creating smart contracts but it seems to be overly safe and simplistic almost arbitrarily so Satoshi never envisaged the full possibilities of smart contracts whereas Vitalik does that s the difference Therefore without knowing anything else I would place my bet on ETH Creating something simplistic does not guarantee security BUT does prevent you from creating amazing things Whereas you can still create secure audited provably secure contracts in a turing complete system AND you are still able to create whatever you like Totally agree with Andreas and you about hashing power Bitcoin is currently a lot safer and most of the hashing power for ETH is spent on running the smart contracts but that will change and if ETH switches to PoS it s a whole different argument	UgxCSn1mc9xHw9F4kkF4AaABAg.8cEvFiLJN1v8cOx_KcRC7r	2018-02-08T08:24:07.000Z	Reply	qE_E7CWK4i8	Does Ethereum compete against Bitcoin & can they work together? - Andreas M.

million transactions per day would equal around transactions per second thats what Ethereum can do currently With upgrades that are expected to be released the network is expected to be able to max at million transactions per second Or around Billion per hour Its whats needed for the network to be adopted world wide it wont be able to handle the load otherwise	UgyFSPkkRvc4-Ds2jSd4AaABAg.8fvdj38sL6G8fwNEwPT9VK	2018-05-07T06:45:29.000Z	Reply	9DIb0F8YV24	$15,000 Ethereum In 2018, Goldman Sachs Gets In On Bitcoin And Ethereum Enterprise Alliance Roadmap

Hi David I have to complement you on your prediction that BCN will be picked up by crypto starters in your Bytecoin video I am one of those newbies in cryptocurrency and I started with Bytecoin Acquiring Bitcoin altcoin is a pretty complex procedure which I m not yet comfartable with I came to know about a new altcoin that hits the market on november The altcoin has a buzz going around and claims to make cryptocurrency easy to use and therefor avalaible to the masses through their smartphone The name of this altcoin is Electroneum Electroneum has several advantages and I m slowly realizing that Electroneum can be become the new Bitcoin I have the following crypto related QUESTION for you What is your opinion on Electroneum They say Electroneum is going to revolutionize gaming currency and you can simply mine Electroneum on your smarphone with an app that also includes a game Will Electroneum make cryptocurrency available to the masses So is Electroneum the new Bitcoin or will Electroneum disappear in the huge pile of anonymous altcoins I look forward to your reply I hope you make a video on Electroneum BTW The price of Electroneum during the token presale till the official launch on november is only dollarcent I invested a little amount hoping the value of Electroneum will exceed the value of Bitcoin within a year If your are interested in purchasing Electroneum during the token presale I would appreciate if you purchase Electroneum with my referal code C OR by visiting the Electroneum website using this URL That would give us both an additional extra Electroneum Once you got Electroneum you will get your personal referal code which you can utilise to promote Electroneum within your network Regards Runnie	UgxNP9KHRJVmllkW0iF4AaABAg	2017-09-30T15:00:05.000Z	Comment	rsn5QNdnB4A	Ethereum vs Bitcoin - A beginners guide to investing

Average people don t seem to realize that the only way for Bitfinex to avoid the liability on their books is to do a manipulated crash of BTC and other tokens to or claim another hack Well the first option sounds more tempting as they can magically exponentially grow their income Bitmex could be used as an intermediary to obtain X leverage that way only some millions of USDT printed become sufficient and not raise many red flag Beginner investors are told by corrupt special interest people and those brainwashed in the internet TV and other medias Just buy the dip Who said their will be any dip K to only needs few seconds to happen remember ETH flash crash to cents when poor Coinbase paid the price and it s maybe not even their fault with all the available trading options available today I do not advise anyone to go short bcz again Tether may be trying to take over Wall Street and short real commodities to take it to the next level Just stay away The most unethical thing you can do is try to take advantage and do trades even if you have the best guaranteed insider info from Tether Bitfinex club	UgyvebRfDIQXL33GZ994AaABAg	2017-12-03T10:39:11.000Z	Comment	eoYET6mhzQk	Coinbase Co-founder Fred Ehrsam break silence on Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin future on platform!!

Hyperledger is a big company composed of more than Fabric I do not think a lot of people know that this year and next is a game changer for crypto and not in a good way Billions of dollars coming and going in the crypto space and we all want a piece of it either short term or long term But most of these whitepaper companies are crap and they just give you a coin or token and take your ETH and then they sell the ETH and profit tremendously Yea its speculative and distracting when there is AMA youtube discussions and weekly updates and it can seem real It does not take millions or billions to startup a company maybe to maintain one for the next years There are huge legitimate real companies with functioning products without any coins or tokens and it would surprise many of you which ones have the technology in place that will drown these failed whitepaper mainnet launch hype I did my research and I am very sad about what I found because I am a crypto holder I hope to sell my crap coins when the market goes back up and exchange for either BTC or ETH before I lose most of the profit Get out while you can and only invest in BTC and ETH and hodl Should be another interesting ride for the year FYI like all people say this is not financial advice and just an opinion do your research etc etc But Holy when you do your research its really disheartening	Ugx8mHSxDnzzGAmY70F4AaABAg	2018-06-17T20:41:41.000Z	Comment	NIPTUVlrU7M	Public vs Private Blockchain - Bitcoin and Ethereum vs HyperLedger and Quorum

Its all about investor protection regulation The ICO ban in China is an example of how governments implement protective regulation to protect low level investors like us from losing their life savings As Ethereum operates from Switzerland and you can identify its company directors Ethereum are providing something more than BTC legal certainty For this reason EU regulators will view Ether as much safer investment vehicle than Bitcoin	UgzZAKy-PHxtpN3OYxN4AaABAg	2017-09-05T13:42:37.000Z	Comment	mIue0hFk4Yw	ETHEREUM VS BITCOIN
