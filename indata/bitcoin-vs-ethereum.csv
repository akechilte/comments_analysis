ETH is centralized and controlled They have already manipulated their ledger to reverse monetary transactions If you hold ETH you are trusting corporations with your money If you hold BTC you are trusting yourself and no one can take your BTC away from you because it is DECENTRALIZED Corporate shills will never explain the centralization issue You don t need block chain for smart contracts if your platform is centralized Just use a database The true value of bitcoin is that it cannot be tampered with unlike all the other currencies available not just crypto currencies All alt coins will eventually go to because everything they do can be done in immutable fashion on the one true blockchain BITCOIN the people s money	2018-08-04T14:33:09.000Z	Comment	0UBk1e5qnr4	Ethereum Vs.

berserker The certain conditions referred to in the video are coded into the smart contract It could be a date a block height a winning bid another specific account making a transaction really anything If you wanted them to they could be the estate agent making a transaction to indicate that the house is sold if you want it to be that but it doesn t have to be at all So don t call Aimstone a dirty liar without a full understanding of smart contracts yourself	2018-01-14T11:31:39.000Z	Reply	d94l-_3B6dM	Ethereum vs Bitcoin Explained For Beginners
You are a dirty liar decentralized apps and smart contracts do not cut out the middle men i mean you said it yourself a smart contract can be programmed to pay out when certain conditions are met But where do these conditions come from The conditions for a smart contract to execute will practically be when the middle men tells it to Example Im selling my house the deed is in the blockchain but it wont change hands until the real estate agent lawyer has given it the green light the smart contract wont know until then it needs the signal from these people or their equivalents first So you basically just added an unnecessary and complicated layer with the smart contract creating an even bigger need for middle men	2018-01-14T09:08:55.000Z	Reply	d94l-_3B6dM	Ethereum vs Bitcoin Explained For Beginners

Thanks Ivan for the wonderful video I have watched most of your videos which are really helpful to understand new technologies But still I have some confusion to understand the key concept of blockchain technology If you could clarify those it would be of great help Let s say I am going to develop a facebook type application which uses blockchain technology and smart contract just like ethereum Now I have users Mr A B J Mr A sends an image to Mr B Where the data will be stored Will it be stored in every machine from Mr A to Mr J What kind of language can I use for user interface creation If Mr A wants to pay some amount to Mr B based on smart contract whether it can be done through traditional payment system without using cryptocurrency	2018-01-28T15:58:14.000Z	Comment	Egp8wNvu6k8	Programmer explains blockchain | Ethereum vs Bitcoin blockchain

I can see unsolvable problems who ever really understands the technology please answer The ledger is the center of the whole technology This is nothing but a database encrypted by whatever size blocks in case of bitcoin it is Mb The more transactions happen the more the size of this Database grows And remember each participant node or call it miner has to have the whole Ledger in order to participate So am I going to store a Tb file on my laptop in a few years What about years from now Is it going to grow Tb The other big problem is in case of any transaction the miner has to decrypt all blocks back in history because it wanna make sure the bitcoins involved in the transaction are legit therefore the miner traces the history of that bitcoin all the way back to the source when it was originally mined This is defined in the white paper this is how thrust is created Imagine the CPU power needed to decrypt back and force a Tb file for every transaction The CPU power the storage space the network speed needed for bitcoin is ever expanding When it will choak nobody can guess When there will be very few bitcoins left million is the maximum if I remember well who the hell will mine them anymore When more and more miners quit who will provide the CPU power to conduct the transactions I understand this is why they are moving to proof of stake mining but I don t think it will help in this case I tie up bitcoin for months just to be able to mine the next bitcoin which will ever get harder to get Again who is going to provide the CPU power after a certain threshold to keep transactions going My guess when most coins are already mined miners will abandon the bitcoin network and we people will be stuck with our tiny wallets	2017-11-16T12:41:16.000Z	Comment	Egp8wNvu6k8	Programmer explains blockchain | Ethereum vs Bitcoin blockchain

From my understanding we will have to start paying the miners to continue mining by attaching fees with each coin transaction we make However what I do not understand is how it expected to continue since the miners will only want to accept the highest paying transactions It seems as if some type of centralized entity will need to regulate either fees or who and how the block chains are mined after all the bitcoin is released	2017-12-04T01:52:46.000Z	Reply	Egp8wNvu6k8	Programmer explains blockchain Ethereum vs Bitcoin blockchain

In general I found his answers to be quite unsatisfying The supposed safety argument of keeping Bitcoin rather than Ether as the value carrying cryptocurrency makes things unnecessarily complicated and achieves the exact opposite by making things less safe And the hashrate thing is matter of time if miners switch to the coin most profitable price reward rate Bitcoin will soon be less safer Oh well	2018-02-04T10:51:25.000Z	Comment	qE_E7CWK4i8	Does Ethereum compete against Bitcoin & can they work together? - Andreas M.

I think you are totally right but ultimately it s because he doesn t know the answer like of people in this space My own argument is that Bitcoin might be safer for creating smart contracts but it seems to be overly safe and simplistic almost arbitrarily so Satoshi never envisaged the full possibilities of smart contracts whereas Vitalik does that s the difference Therefore without knowing anything else I would place my bet on ETH Creating something simplistic does not guarantee security BUT does prevent you from creating amazing things Whereas you can still create secure audited provably secure contracts in a turing complete system AND you are still able to create whatever you like Totally agree with Andreas and you about hashing power Bitcoin is currently a lot safer and most of the hashing power for ETH is spent on running the smart contracts but that will change and if ETH switches to PoS it s a whole different argument	2018-02-08T08:24:07.000Z	Reply	qE_E7CWK4i8	Does Ethereum compete against Bitcoin can they work together Andreas M Antonopoulos

The fact that Goldman start to trade for its costumers means that they bring speculators long and short together and I doubt if they will take positions in cryptocurrencies with their own money One bird don t forecast the summer BTW all cryptocurrency buyers are speculators with greed with no fundamentals The BIG boys are playing with the many little speculators LOL	2018-05-07T14:16:43.000Z	Comment	9DIb0F8YV24	$15,000 Ethereum In 2018, Goldman Sachs Gets In On Bitcoin And Ethereum Enterprise Alliance Roadmap

million transactions per day would equal around transactions per second thats what Ethereum can do currently With upgrades that are expected to be released the network is expected to be able to max at million transactions per second Or around Billion per hour Its whats needed for the network to be adopted world wide it wont be able to handle the load otherwise	2018-05-07T06:45:29.000Z	Reply	9DIb0F8YV24	Ethereum In Goldman Sachs Gets In On Bitcoin And Ethereum Enterprise Alliance Roadmap

Hi David I have to complement you on your prediction that BCN will be picked up by crypto starters in your Bytecoin video I am one of those newbies in cryptocurrency and I started with Bytecoin Acquiring Bitcoin altcoin is a pretty complex procedure which I m not yet comfartable with I came to know about a new altcoin that hits the market on november The altcoin has a buzz going around and claims to make cryptocurrency easy to use and therefor avalaible to the masses through their smartphone The name of this altcoin is Electroneum Electroneum has several advantages and I m slowly realizing that Electroneum can be become the new Bitcoin I have the following crypto related QUESTION for you What is your opinion on Electroneum They say Electroneum is going to revolutionize gaming currency and you can simply mine Electroneum on your smarphone with an app that also includes a game Will Electroneum make cryptocurrency available to the masses So is Electroneum the new Bitcoin or will Electroneum disappear in the huge pile of anonymous altcoins I look forward to your reply I hope you make a video on Electroneum BTW The price of Electroneum during the token presale till the official launch on november is only dollarcent I invested a little amount hoping the value of Electroneum will exceed the value of Bitcoin within a year If your are interested in purchasing Electroneum during the token presale I would appreciate if you purchase Electroneum with my referal code C OR by visiting the Electroneum website using this URL That would give us both an additional extra Electroneum Once you got Electroneum you will get your personal referal code which you can utilise to promote Electroneum within your network Regards Runnie	2017-09-30T15:00:05.000Z	Comment	rsn5QNdnB4A	Ethereum vs Bitcoin - A beginners guide to investing

Average people don t seem to realize that the only way for Bitfinex to avoid the liability on their books is to do a manipulated crash of BTC and other tokens to or claim another hack Well the first option sounds more tempting as they can magically exponentially grow their income Bitmex could be used as an intermediary to obtain X leverage that way only some millions of USDT printed become sufficient and not raise many red flag Beginner investors are told by corrupt special interest people and those brainwashed in the internet TV and other medias Just buy the dip Who said their will be any dip K to only needs few seconds to happen remember ETH flash crash to cents when poor Coinbase paid the price and it s maybe not even their fault with all the available trading options available today I do not advise anyone to go short bcz again Tether may be trying to take over Wall Street and short real commodities to take it to the next level Just stay away The most unethical thing you can do is try to take advantage and do trades even if you have the best guaranteed insider info from Tether Bitfinex club	2017-12-03T10:39:11.000Z	Comment	eoYET6mhzQk	Coinbase Co-founder Fred Ehrsam break silence on Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin future on platform!!

OMG did you just say LTC is a copy of BTC FALSE When comparing transaction speed and cost of transfer LTC trumps BTC LTC is also implementing LITEPAY and several other projects to roll out later this year So to sum it all up I can make a safe price prediction that LTC will reach no less than and no higher than within this year alone If you doubt it do some followup research to confirm but when it happens I hope you are all on the train before it leaves the station LTC is the bull coin of for smaller investors to make big gains with little capital to invest Bitcoin is going to have another serious run this year as well but from a price prospective that is not ideal for the smaller investors to make substantial gains That being said BeatTheBush SAY WHAAAAAAAA lol	2018-02-11T15:27:02.000Z	Comment	eeZ4V2Ka40Y	Bitcoin and Ethereum Beginners Guide

Hyperledger is a big company composed of more than Fabric I do not think a lot of people know that this year and next is a game changer for crypto and not in a good way Billions of dollars coming and going in the crypto space and we all want a piece of it either short term or long term But most of these whitepaper companies are crap and they just give you a coin or token and take your ETH and then they sell the ETH and profit tremendously Yea its speculative and distracting when there is AMA youtube discussions and weekly updates and it can seem real It does not take millions or billions to startup a company maybe to maintain one for the next years There are huge legitimate real companies with functioning products without any coins or tokens and it would surprise many of you which ones have the technology in place that will drown these failed whitepaper mainnet launch hype I did my research and I am very sad about what I found because I am a crypto holder I hope to sell my crap coins when the market goes back up and exchange for either BTC or ETH before I lose most of the profit Get out while you can and only invest in BTC and ETH and hodl Should be another interesting ride for the year FYI like all people say this is not financial advice and just an opinion do your research etc etc But Holy when you do your research its really disheartening	2018-06-17T20:41:41.000Z	Comment	NIPTUVlrU7M	Public vs Private Blockchain - Bitcoin and Ethereum vs HyperLedger and Quorum

I feel disappointed You are showing a chart where you get like k for a initial investment on capital release but that it s not true I found out that every daily reinvest i make it represents a new loan which will be released after each Like this guy is saying Each reinvest is its own new loan So on the day of your capital release you get that amount in USD back It s in bitconnect tokens so it needs to be be converted Then a few days later at the end of ITS term of days you get your first reinvestment back Then the second a few days after that and so on At minimum it ll take days to receive all your capital and interest back from bitconnect assuming you reinvested all your interest earnings So what am I to expect after days for an initial investment after all	2017-12-24T19:07:11.000Z	Comment	PnG7ir_nq8I	Hashflare Bitcoin Mining |  Ethereum Mining vs Bitcoin Mining
