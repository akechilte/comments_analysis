I have tremendous respect for Rafa and he is one of my favourite players but honestly I cannot stand the hypocrisy of his fans You always accuse Federer fans of coming up with all sorts of excuses when he loses whereas in actual fact you always play the injury card whenever he loses Also why do you always bring the GOAT debate into the picture Why not simply congratulate Federer when he wins rather than always throwing that weak era nonsense of yours Seriously Fed and Nadal are both great so stop comparing and stop making excuses for Nadal losing When he loses it means he simply wasn t good enough on the day or he got outplayed thats it He s not injured every single time he loses So stop accusing Fed fans of making excuses when you are a million times worse And learn to respect other players too	2018-11-19T22:07:42.000Z	Comment	mFIOGpIQtVU	Roger Federer vs Rafael Nadal - Australian Open 2017 Final (highlights HD)

Marcos Villavicencio Federer has a minimum of titles in each GS outside Roland Garros Also hard surface is a generic term Carpet and cement are very different If you play tennis you will know the difference easily That means he has only ONE GS on carpet No doubt Nadal is the best ever on clay of his titles and of his GS are on that surface with records that will most likely remain forever On the other hand he has never been able to defend ANY title on a surface that is not clay and has lost on other surfaces to players like Pouille Fognini Blake Youzhny Darcis M ller Rosol Finally there is the indoor surface performance namely the Master s Championship Federer has won it times vs Nadal none	2018-07-16T03:35:20.000Z	Reply	yM7Gzhout_g	Roger Federer Vs Rafael Nadal Miami Final Highlights HDvia torchbrowser com

agradina Some Federer fans are just retarded Federer beat a bad version of Nadal that is nowhere near as good as his pre versions and they think he solved the Rafa puzzle Apart from the Australian open final which he played ok Like compared to this Nadal he was just bad nowhere near his best level His Indian wells Miami Shanghai matches were honestly the nightmare level of Nadal Because here he was actually healthy and in his prime he could track down balls forcing errors or creating winners that the post Nadal would never even dream of reaching Just because of this fact alone Federer then Federer before and Federer now would not be able to handle this Nadal Federer is a great player and really talented but he is just sooo overated He won so many of his big titles either when especially Nadal and Djokovic weren t there when they where young and not fully developed all court players or when they were out of form injured In my eyes he will never be the best because in a solitary sport you cant be considered the best when you can win almost only if your biggest rivals are not in top shape When either of them Nadal Djokovic are in top form they are simply too much for Federer to handle and only a delusional fanatic fedtard cant see it	2018-08-05T00:49:38.000Z	Reply	2owjhcrUBI0	Australian Open Federer vs Nadal Semifinal Full Match

there is mass misconception about Rafa s will to destroy his body which is perpetuated by a small percentage of disgruntled Fedfans Nadal has a growth related defect called Kohler s feet which has absolutely nothing to do with his berserker grinder style of play it is congenital There are many other beserking grinders on tour who have lasted quite long on the Tour without needing to take extensive breaks like Nadal did in and David Ferrer The Little Beast Thomas Muster The Comeback Player of the s and Guillermo Vilas The s Clay God played as intensely as Rafa played at ages older than Rafa played more matches overall not Muster and haven t needed to take so many breaks from the tennis circuit to rest their knees or nurse some unlucky injury Nadal was the st great tennis player to be criticized for his playing style This was started by Fedfans who considered Roger the better player even when He lost the ranking to Nadal and was being dominated by him from Even Federer says that he has been lucky that he has been injury free most of his career He never attributes it to his playing style Kyrgios has been injured more often than Nadal and he isn t a grinder	2018-11-11T01:05:26.000Z	Comment	MG7ff19Db34	Australian Open 2009 Final - Nadal vs Federer Highlights HD

Pearcewreck So you re saying a player can t have favorite surfaces that s so narrow minded Just because Roger says grass is his favorite it doesn t mean hard isn t Who cares what the stats say I care lots of other tennis fans and tennis experts care they don t calculate those for nothing you know Stats is Math Math is Science and Science means truth and the Earth is not flat regardless of what you say And according to the stats hard court favors Federer more than Nadal The following tournaments you mentioned about are irrelevant cause we re talking about H Hs Like i said before the bigger the sample size is the more relevant the H H is gonna be That is the most basic rule of statistical math is certainly significant at some point but is it as and are I doubt it Plus none of those meetings are in GS where Nadal excels the most which makes it even less relevant Even if the ATP regards as enough it doesn t mean a H H with matches should be meaningful and it obviously shouldn t I agree there s much more to it than just H H but it s still a very important factor to consider when it comes to comparing players of the same era who have faced each other plenty of times because tennis is a H H sport all in all Roger s inferior in H Hs against his biggest rivals have always been a big obstacle to his GOATness if it ever exists at all Other than H H there are lots of other arguments that can be summed up in this blog if you re interested	2018-04-27T09:17:15.000Z	Reply	nJsc-PDAhFc	Federer vs Nadal All H H Match Points HD
You completely contradict yourself with your own stats If Roger s win rate on Grass is higher than Hard than Grass is favourite according to the stats Plus who cares what the stats say He has always said Grass is his favourite surface Wimbledon is his favourite tournament If Rafa s win rate on Hard is less than Roger s it just proves he isn t as good on Hard as Roger Both are the best ever on their favourite surface Roger is a lot better on Hard that Rafa both aren t great on their weakest but granted Rafa with Wimbledon s has a slight edge over Roger with only FO But across their whole career s Rafa has only won Grass tournaments at all levels Roger has won Clay So beyond the Slams Roger has a better record on Clay than Rafa does on Grass Overall Roger is better Sorry but matches in the history of tennis rivalries is significant We live in unusual times where the big have played each other sooooo many times One of the most famous of all rivalries Borg v McEnroe involved only Tour matches So is very significant As I said previously the ATP regard as enough So yeah Thiem does have a better H H than Roger At least Thiem is a half decent player compared to Dustin Brown But my point is much more to it than H H	2018-04-27T08:06:18.000Z	Reply	nJsc-PDAhFc	Federer vs Nadal All H H Match Points HD
Pearcewreck Nadal s winning rate on hard court is while Federer s is which is only lower than his winning rate on grass court so it s safe to say hard court is Federer s favorite surface as well rather than Nadal s The larger the sample size is the more meaningful the statistics is gonna be and is undeniably too small compared to and What s more a H H only reflects a complete rivalry if it has pretty much all kinds of match in it and Davydenko has never faced Nadal in a Grand Slam match aka best of where Nadal excels the most I can pretend Thiem s winning rate over Federer or Kokkinakis s matters but i don t	2018-04-20T04:21:45.000Z	Reply	nJsc-PDAhFc	Federer vs Nadal All H H Match Points HD
You are so wrong Firstly they only played on Fed s favourite surface Grass But they played on Nadal s favourite surface Clay That explains it right there Watch the video an awful lot of Red stuff especially early on Please don t distort the stats there are only surfaces these days so by definition Hardcourt must be Nadal s second favourite surface as well Therefore they have played of matches on Nadal s favourite surfaces Clay Hardcourt Only times on Grass Also hate to break it to you matches is not tiny considering the ATP regard the minimum for an official rivalry is So matches against Davydenko matters	2018-04-20T02:50:40.000Z	Reply	nJsc-PDAhFc	Federer vs Nadal All H H Match Points HD

Nadal entered the match mentally defeated I think it was the first time he started a match against Federer knowing he would lose Because he had everything to win that tournament he d had an comfortable draw while Federer s way to the final was tortuous overcoming some tougher opponents and prevailing in a couple of epic matches Considering that and the fact that he is five years younger and that he had dominated their clashes in the past you would ve thought he was going to win comfortably In the first couple of Federe s services games Nadal was putting so much pressure and seemed like he was going to take control of the match But he never believed in victory Federer on the other hand was feeling so confident relaxed and that s when he becomes the most dangerous opponent you could face So to me Federer won Miami from the very moment he obliterated Nadal at Indian Wells It was a beating that really harmed Rafa and for the first time in his career he was afraid of facing Roger None of them played great in this match but Federer was just so clutch when it mattered	2018-10-02T04:21:37.000Z	Comment	YodDtl3zke0	Roger Federer vs Rafael Nadal Highlights Miami 2017 FINAL

Hello let say tennis fans Today is So i think my comment is more interesting than years ago Because now Roger Federer won grand slams and day ago Rafael Nadal win Roland garros for the th time and win grand slams But for sure is that this super champs are the best tennis players of all time And let see the next years how it will be because there is a rd player that belongs to the greatest But not jet And this rd champ is Novak Djokovic At the moment he won majors So for this we must wait let say more years I think than we can say who is the best of all time Personally i am a big fan of Rafael Nadal I always think what if Nadal didn t had so many injuries in his career How many injuries Roger had compare with Rafa Hey with all the respect for Roger Federer But i think if Nadal had the same many times injuries like what Federer had i really think that Nadal won more Grand slams than the great Roger Federer That s how i think Greetings from holland and sorry if my english is not so good	2018-06-12T16:49:54.000Z	Comment	v9KayB3dJHE	Roger Federer vs. Rafael Nadal - Who Is The Greatest?

of course at the moment given that they are still active players it is the case that Roger is the GOAT until further notice but there is a strange thing here the GOAT despite winning the last five matches played against Rafa is still trailing the head to head stats by something like five or six matches it seems clear that Roger understands this the GOAT has a losing record against the next GOAT and this is the reason why Roger has decided not to play the clay tournaments that losing record will not change if Roger played Monte Carlo Madrid and Rome the three Masters level clay tournaments we are letting go of Barcelona which is a level tournament he would lose against Rafa with perhaps his best chance to win against the Spaniard in Madrid high altitude faster balls there is a chance Roger if still an active player in the next few years will once again play the clay tournaments if Rafa retires NOW so there can be no doubt that the most important reason why Roger no longer plays clay court tournaments is Rafa so we have the rather crazy situation that the GOAT is afraid of the next GoAT on clay	2018-06-11T07:10:15.000Z	Comment	v9KayB3dJHE	Roger Federer vs. Rafael Nadal - Who Is The Greatest?

actually Roger and Rafa are both extremely good Doubles Players Roger and Rafa won gold in olympics doubles for their respective nations and Rafa has won Indian Wells with his doubles partner Marc Lopez it s just that I think this was their first time playing together so they might not have worked out everything Doubles also let s you hide your weaknesses so Querrey and Sock s usual weaknesses in singles were hidden such as inability to cover the court with the same speed as roger or rafa and it s much easier to hold serve in doubles when you have a really good net player and Sock is a doubles specialist	2018-09-20T03:05:35.000Z	Reply	YPfoDgQSe94	Laver Cup Doubles R Nadal R Federer vs S Querrey J Sock FULL MATCH

You didn t put a lot of thought into it because AS I SAID it was an anti Federer post and you re a Nadal fan Why bother when it wasn t against Rafa Of course you think it s funny If he had said No Roger No Party for Rafa you most likely would have replied I don t think you would find it funny either	2018-09-27T04:11:39.000Z	Reply	ChRd_XUpgBI	Federer Nadal vs Querrey Sock Laver Cup Highlights HD
shadapakap Honestly That was my first impression I didn t put a lot of thought into it I classified it as ironic becuase for me No Rafa no Party was funny to read and it has nothing to do with me being her fan As I said you are reading a lot into the OP s comment I simply didn t	2018-09-27T04:06:11.000Z	Reply	ChRd_XUpgBI	Federer Nadal vs Querrey Sock Laver Cup Highlights HD
How was it ironic	2018-09-27T04:02:39.000Z	Reply	ChRd_XUpgBI	Federer Nadal vs Querrey Sock Laver Cup Highlights HD
shadapakap It s pretty clear you don t know me at all I don t know if you have seen my channel with the other account but I created a video of Roger and Rafa citing that they are the best example of sportsmanship in tennis That said I don t take comments like the OP s very seriously It didn t bother me because I thought it was ironic and I proved it by saying that also Roger is good at doubles I have no idea why you re taking this conversation so seriously and being so aggressive at times It s just tennis	2018-09-27T03:38:26.000Z	Reply	ChRd_XUpgBI	Federer Nadal vs Querrey Sock Laver Cup Highlights HD
His comment was clearly anti Federer but since you re a Nadal fan you weren t bothered by his comment even though you admitted that Federer is actually a good doubles player which was the opposite of what he said It s called bias	2018-09-27T03:33:35.000Z	Reply	ChRd_XUpgBI	Federer Nadal vs Querrey Sock Laver Cup Highlights HD
Everything you say has already been addressed to in my previous replies You re basically just wasting my and your time here	2018-09-27T03:26:53.000Z	Reply	ChRd_XUpgBI	Federer Nadal vs Querrey Sock Laver Cup Highlights HD
shadapakap Ok let me see I read your first comment to the OP Rafa and Novak would have made a worse tandem Stupid Nadal fan Given that I m a Nadal fan I only pointed out that both Nadal and Federer were good at doubles and that I didn t understand your comment as I interpreted the OP comment as a bit ironic with the No Rafa no Party hence why I had nothing to say about that comment and I was curious to see if we had the same opinion about why Nole and Rafa would have been worse Then we simply got lost in translation with you calling me dumb and all that when I m always respectful That s pretty much what happened Have a good night	2018-09-27T03:02:09.000Z	Reply	ChRd_XUpgBI	Federer Nadal vs Querrey Sock Laver Cup Highlights HD
I already answered why Rafa and Novak would have been a worse tandem and I already explained why I said it in the first place I also explained towards whom my initial reply was directed What else don t you understand	2018-09-27T02:52:44.000Z	Reply	ChRd_XUpgBI	Federer Nadal vs Querrey Sock Laver Cup Highlights HD
shadapakap yes I did But probably you didn t read what I wrote by the way I forgot to switch my account I m the same person	2018-09-27T02:45:38.000Z	Reply	ChRd_XUpgBI	Federer Nadal vs Querrey Sock Laver Cup Highlights HD
Did you even read anything I said	2018-09-27T02:42:24.000Z	Reply	ChRd_XUpgBI	Federer Nadal vs Querrey Sock Laver Cup Highlights HD
shadapakap I think we have massive communications issues in here You said Novak and Rafa would have been a worse combo and i was just wondering why I said Rafa was good at doubles and now i add that even with being good and Federer is good too not having played together before resulted in a less than perfect performance even if they won Last year Rafa lost with Berdych I remember that match as Berdych and Rafa don t have any chemistry together and that s even more important than being good at doubles If you are playing doubles you have to be able to efficiently communicate with your partner and know him well enough to predict to an extent his position during certain points I never said Federer wasn t good actually they lost federer and djokovic because of reasons Novak is not a double specialist he didn t have the same chemistry communication skills that Roger had with Rafa which helped a little they were playing against strong opponents that played together many times before with Sock being the best double player this year even most than last year So all this back and forth between us was totally unnecessary because you assumed my question was rethoric when I actually wanted you to elaborate it and in the end we are even saying the same thing Probably Rafa and Nole would be even worse because Nole is not a specialist and they don t exactly have chemistry on court I just wanted you to clarify and elaborate your answer and you went on attacking me Ah well	2018-09-26T21:19:31.000Z	Reply	ChRd_XUpgBI	Federer Nadal vs Querrey Sock Laver Cup Highlights HD
Also if you remember from last year s Laver Cup Nadal teamed up with Berdych against Sock Kyrgios and LOST One can also say that the only reason why he beat Sock Querrey was because of Roger but I m not as small minded as the OP	2018-09-24T05:19:19.000Z	Reply	ChRd_XUpgBI	Federer Nadal vs Querrey Sock Laver Cup Highlights HD
So are you saying that Federer isn t a good doubles player because the only reason why they won last year was because he played with Rafa Novak is obviously not a good doubles player and I don t think he s going to have a better chemistry with Rafa since they re both baseline players	2018-09-24T03:46:56.000Z	Reply	ChRd_XUpgBI	Federer Nadal vs Querrey Sock Laver Cup Highlights HD

shadapakap Oh well I lost this comment when you call me dumb You should learn to be respectful of people you don t know but thanks again for the compliment feel free to insult whenever you feel like it maybe that will make you feel better	2018-09-24T03:40:48.000Z	Reply	ChRd_XUpgBI	Federer Nadal vs Querrey Sock Laver Cup Highlights HD
No I am not slow but thanks for the compliment My first comment was directed towards you and yes I have read the OP comment but I had nothing relevant to say about it He was implying that with Rafa they would have won but since i disagree to a certain extent I let it at it I was just curious to know why you thought Rafa Nole would be a lot worse that was the only purpose of my comment TO YOU not in relation to the OP s comment I pointed out that Rafa is good at doubles and that was that Do we need to keep going on with this useless debate or are we good Cheers	2018-09-24T03:37:34.000Z	Reply	ChRd_XUpgBI	Federer Nadal vs Querrey Sock Laver Cup Highlights HD
Since you re too slow to understand what s going on We re both replying to the OP s comment in case you re not aware My very first reply was directed towards his comment I suggest you read his comment so you know where I was coming from with my first reply You called me out after my first reply so my second and subsequent replies were all directed towards you Is everything clear now or do you still not understand what s going on here	2018-09-24T03:31:55.000Z	Reply	ChRd_XUpgBI	Federer Nadal vs Querrey Sock Laver Cup Highlights HD

This is the match where Federer let Rafa into his head Fed has humped Rafa in the first set and was looking like the only winner However at the start of the nd set there was a call of out on a Rafa shot Fed saw it and said nothing The ball was actually in and it made Fed look a bit dodgy and dishonest From that moment on Fed s standard slipped and he choked on almost every break point he had on Rafa I think he had It was shocking to watch If Fed had managed to grab the th set tiebreak it may well have been a different result but we will never know Rafa has French but only an average of at all the other slams Can hardly call him the GOAT Plus Fed has almost double the weeks spent at number one compared to Rafa so there simply can be no comparison	2018-02-08T17:01:13.000Z	Comment	eITz2Awefa8	Rafael Nadal vs Roger Federer - French Open 2006 Final Full Highlights HD

This match was close despite those lopsided first sets Nadal hadn t fully mastered the art of hitting exclusively to Federer s backhand yet according to the stats Federer s backhand potency was at a staggering low in this match all time worst vs Nadal which means it cost him points for every shots he played on that wing That s more than enough to easily lose this match and even a slightly better value even if negative could have given him victory And that s even worse than when he got bulldozed in the third set The AO wasn t much better Federer was locked on the backhand side on many points recording a BHP of and made a volley of errors on the Forehand too while Nadal played Pass me please around him at the net But this year at the Australian open though Fed s backhand potency was up at a staggering which is so high it s an anomaly Notable point It had never been positive against Nadal at any previous grand slam	2017-07-28T16:41:51.000Z	Comment	eITz2Awefa8	Rafael Nadal vs Roger Federer - French Open 2006 Final Full Highlights HD

I was referring at his lack of mental strenght not overall but when it comes to the rivalry with Nadal especially on clay Imo his backhand was good enough to beat Rafa at RG In Rome Final when he played more freely almost won the match His backhand is not guilty for wasting the momentum he had at the FO in after he won the first set so convincingly or for wasting countless BP in final What about loosing in straights after leading in final Definitely having an one handed backhand can be bad news when it comes to facing Rafa at the French but that doesn t mean that it s impossible to beat him there even in these circumstances	2018-06-14T17:59:40.000Z	Reply	eITz2Awefa8	Rafael Nadal vs Roger Federer French Open Final Full Highlights HD

It s not that Nadal was the only one who was capable of challenging it but Nadal s forehand was so laggy and had so much top spin that there was no way Roger was going to be able to counter it There were other players who could do it but they weren t as good as Rafa One of Roger s best shots his backhand slice was also completely nullified because Rafa s forehand was so laggy Who knows if Roger could have won majors with a H backhand He might have won even more considering how many damn finals he lost to Rafa Roger s probably the most naturally talented out of the three big boys so he might have been able to make it work He would have definitely had much much better results versus Rafa with it The H H Rafa leads against Roger doesn t prove anything I m not saying Roger s better than Rafa I think right now the two of them are equally impressive but I am saying that the H H doesn t really conclude anything that s valuable Yes it s lopsided but that doesn t prove that Rafa is better it just proves that Rafa s tennis is made to eat Roger s tennis alive I said both guys because you said he s losing the HC H H with both guys However there s a very clear reason why he s losing the H H with Nole So that tackles the whole both guys argument	2018-06-13T10:20:24.000Z	Reply	eITz2Awefa8	Rafael Nadal vs Roger Federer French Open Final Full Highlights HD

NLLeFa The reason Federer s even losing the HC H H versus both these guys is because he kept playing when most would retire The average age of retirement is years old His physique has thoroughly declined but he kept playing because he loved tennis Had he retired at the normal retirement age let s say for ease He would have led the HC Major H H with nole Federer and Nole s primes never alligned and Federer and Nole met more times when Federer was out of prime than when Nole was still a teenager That s how the H H was turned around	2018-06-13T09:44:00.000Z	Reply	eITz2Awefa8	Rafael Nadal vs Roger Federer French Open Final Full Highlights HD

Both these two all time greats have endured in one of most exciting rivalries in the men s over the last years As of January they have won all four Grand Slam tournaments that have been contested since that wonderful match at the Australian Open in Both affirming their status respectively as the Kings of clay and the grass court Rafa would go on to win a th French Open crown and pick up his th hard court major at the US Open in becoming a times Grand Slam Champion While Roger would go on to claim his th Wimbledon in and successfully defend his Australian Open Title the following year to capture his th Grand Slam Title Federer would win all three of their future matchups in on the outdoor hard courts and indoor tournaments they would play Indian Wells Miami and Shanghai Masters Series events Rafa would win more titles at both Monte Carlo for a record th time as well and Madrid Masters events as well as adding Barcelona Masters Series event for a record breaking th time again Adding to his the usual dominance of the clay court season He would end the year as the world number one male tennis player Federer skipped the entire clay court season Together these players have combined to hold the number one ranking for almost years cumulatively hold Grand Slam Titles and Masters Series Titles and ATP Tour Finals Championships Collectively their dominance is greater than any other two male rivals combination in the modern era over the last years	2018-02-10T22:28:39.000Z	Comment	OebjqjMHPos	Uncovered: The Legendary Rivalry of Roger Federer v.

This is precisely why Nadal will never be the goat His game relies on titanic defence and high top spin forehands It works on clay since the surface bounce can be unpredictable but his shot allows him a high margin of error Once on a faster surface his forehands look pathetically slow Nadal has zero ATP final titles NONE No GOAT player can be called GOAT if you can t win a round robin playoff tourney on a hardcore despite having years of opportunities He just gets destroyed every time	2018-07-09T17:18:58.000Z	Comment	KD91j7Mon3I	Roger Federer Destroying Great Players | Rafael Nadal

The T It would be good for the game if Dimitrov can be a real force in Men s tennis He lost the plot in the Istanbul final smashing a heap if rackets But he has started the year in great fashion What is your opinion of Federer s medical time out after the th set It was within the rules but the rules are not in the spirit of a fair contest A player getting treatment during a match I thought it was a physical contest One guy is getting a massage for aches and pains the other guy is wondering Are you nearly ready to resume our match Brilliant Haha	2017-02-01T07:40:00.000Z	Reply	LGKyKrBUwxo	Swiss Indoors Basel Final Roger Federer v Rafael Nadal Highlights
Alan Chong When Federer retires Dimitrov will be my favorite player Love his game	2017-01-31T16:34:40.000Z	Reply	LGKyKrBUwxo	Swiss Indoors Basel Final Roger Federer v Rafael Nadal Highlights
The T I would be good for Dimitrov to finally break through Then he would finally believe in himself that he can get the job done It would change his career Mens tennis is looking interesting again	2017-01-31T14:04:44.000Z	Reply	LGKyKrBUwxo	Swiss Indoors Basel Final Roger Federer v Rafael Nadal Highlights
Alan Chong No idea perhaps because Roger hit with much more power and authority than Rafa French Open I d pick between the trio of Djokovic Nadal and Wawrinka Murray might have a chance but not much better than Federer s chance But really I do want a new face win it Dimitrov perhaps	2017-01-31T09:00:34.000Z	Reply	LGKyKrBUwxo	Swiss Indoors Basel Final Roger Federer v Rafael Nadal Highlights
The T Any ideas why I found Nadal was a bit slower of foot than previously That s expected given the amount of running he s done in his career up till now Any ideas of who you would favour for the French Open Without Murray vs Djokovic the Melbourne tournament was so much better It s like holding a party and making sure you don t invite boring stiffs Haha This year s Aussie Open the best ever Thanks Andy and Novak	2017-01-31T01:43:11.000Z	Reply	LGKyKrBUwxo	Swiss Indoors Basel Final Roger Federer v Rafael Nadal Highlights
Alan Chong What surprised me was that Nadal actually sliced more than Federer Now that s extraordinary	2017-01-30T16:00:20.000Z	Reply	LGKyKrBUwxo	Swiss Indoors Basel Final Roger Federer v Rafael Nadal Highlights
The T Yes he did last night Pat Cash and Federer mentioned the court this year played differently to last year It s faster Fed Cash pointed out that the ball doesn t bounce as high as it used to This made it better for Federer Nadal used to be able to go high to Federer s backhand and force him to play slice That didn t happen at all last night Federer was able to compete from the baseline Federer also served incredibly well It was a great match What a finish to the tournament	2017-01-30T14:39:14.000Z	Reply	LGKyKrBUwxo	Swiss Indoors Basel Final Roger Federer v Rafael Nadal Highlights
Alan Chong In a matter of fact he did beat Nadal both from the baseline and from the net I mean jeez look at those blistering winners from the baseline	2017-01-30T12:47:22.000Z	Reply	LGKyKrBUwxo	Swiss Indoors Basel Final Roger Federer v Rafael Nadal Highlights
The T Yes Nadal just grinds Federer into the court Nadal has a game plan that always works Lefty topsin forehand to Roger s single handed backhand It s boring but it s foolproof Federer should serve and volley more to neutralise it He can t beat Nadal from the baseline	2017-01-29T07:10:13.000Z	Reply	LGKyKrBUwxo	Swiss Indoors Basel Final Roger Federer v Rafael Nadal Highlights
Alan Chong I also think Nadal s gonna win it Federer is like a punching bag for Nadal in the slam outside Wimbledon well Nadal s a non existent in Wimbledon these days I hope I m wrong tho	2017-01-29T05:16:52.000Z	Reply	LGKyKrBUwxo	Swiss Indoors Basel Final Roger Federer v Rafael Nadal Highlights
The T Federer vs Nadal in the Aussie Open Final How is the match going to play out I can t split them It could go either way Federer had the better serve but Nadal can work Rogers backhand all match Nadal in or sets I think I couldn t bet money on it though	2017-01-28T16:39:42.000Z	Reply	LGKyKrBUwxo	Swiss Indoors Basel Final Roger Federer v Rafael Nadal Highlights
Simple Nadal s tactics just not working against Fed in these fast indoor hard courts And besides Nadal s body just can t do that gladiator style of tennis anymore especially in faster surfaces	2017-01-03T17:47:58.000Z	Reply	LGKyKrBUwxo	Swiss Indoors Basel Final Roger Federer v Rafael Nadal Highlights
Arjun Krishna Yes Interestingly Nadal has big wins over Federer at the Australian Open at night which plays like an indoor court Nadal uses the samr strategy against Federer He never waivers from this strategy	2016-05-12T00:23:01.000Z	Reply	LGKyKrBUwxo	Swiss Indoors Basel Final Roger Federer v Rafael Nadal Highlights
Alan Chong I m about a month late with this comment but to answer your question the strategy of just going to the backhand does not work that well for Nadal on indoor hard courts which are typically lower bouncing And with this in mind let us also consider that Federer has a record over Nadal indoors and is much more comfortable when dealing with this tactic On top of that Federer can take care of his own serve pretty well without interference from the elements and dominate with his forehand the wing that Nadal really does not want to hit to I d have been very surprised if Rafa had won this match	2016-05-11T19:57:52.000Z	Reply	LGKyKrBUwxo	Swiss Indoors Basel Final Roger Federer v Rafael Nadal Highlights

Nadal did better than Federer in and and in they both lost early in and Rafa was injured so Nadal only actually avoided Federer in and And it is even because in FO Federer avoided Rafa so thats all so your arugement is moot The H H shows that when Rafa and Fed are at their best Rafa wins Federer is handling Nadal now beating him times in a row but this is not the Old Nadal Nadal is doing good this year but he is not his old self your arugement is moot	2017-04-08T09:08:19.000Z	Reply	LGKyKrBUwxo	Swiss Indoors Basel Final Roger Federer v Rafael Nadal Highlights

People want changes that is why When Sampras won contnously center court wants Richard Karchijeck to win Sampras had to play and must be peak in form because there were wimbledon champions and french open champions To day only one Nadal one Jokovich and no youngsters coming up People like changes and hate monopoly and less competition	2018-07-07T05:16:59.000Z	Reply	3vzoUEPGTtU	Roger Federer vs Rafael Nadal Wimbledon Match point and celebrations
