I am a huge Tom Brady fan and of my home team the NEP I can not say if Tom is the greatest player ever in the NFL but I can say that Tom his story the story of NEP is the wildest and most intriguing I have ever heard I have read and witnessed tons of amazing stories but this is just on another level It s so unscripted and yet inevitable It s why not me times a million The level of self belief and blinders on is just epic how can you not love this story even if you re rooting against him My son is on a CAA football team and I have seen through him and many of his teammates the story of just getting there as an epic act of overcoming and beating the odds and in our wildest dreams we could never expect the level of accomplishment and pure will to succeed as Tom has seen and experienced in his life Is he the greatest football player to ever take the field Couldn t tell you his s sure dictate as much Is he the greatest example of over coming one s own physical being to achieve what no other person ever has Absolutely Through his example of self belief he is the most amazing person in the game right now and the greatest inspiration one could have to push themselves to their goals	2017-09-06T19:54:01.000Z	Comment	7WJHBIUX_S0	Super Bowl LI Ultra Hi-Res 4k Cinematic Highlight | Patriots vs. Falcons | NFL

Bush Jr said he was proud of this moment I think he liked the fact that his parents came out to such a crowd one last time And still I somewhat feel like preparing for multiple days getting out of their beds and riding over half the stadium to do this was slightly empty Maybe it is just me expecting too much like a short speech to motivate the players maybe Anyhow he was the last US president during whose presidency I was not born yet Sure his bio seems controversial but it is still nice of him to do this for his countrymen Rest in Peace	2018-12-01T19:45:49.000Z	Comment	MfBQAZO2Ek4	Super bowl 2017 president george H.

Also to the idiots that complain Manning had better receivers than Brady that is not the case Both QBs had Welker Brady had two of the best although not at the same time in Gronk and Moss Manning s top two receivers were Reggie Wayne and Marvin Harrison If you look at who each man has had on offense its about even And BOTH qbs were famous for turning an average receiver into a household name Dallas Clark did not do shit on any of the teams he was on after Manning Brandon Stokely was the same case Deion Branch was one of the receivers that Brady made So Peyton had two hall of fame receivers and so did Brady the way I see it Peyton had no hall of famers on the offense he played for in Denver And before someone slams me for calling Gronk a receiver he catches footballs I realize he plays tight end but that is still a receiver Tight ends hardly ever block anymore in today s NFL All they do is go out for passes typically But Gronk is that rare tight end in today s game that is an excellent blocker as well He may be the best tight end in NFL history	2018-11-13T19:59:15.000Z	Comment	TDrX9f1c3Qw	Peytons Super Bowl party gone bad

There is no such thing as White Supremacy it is propaganda do not confuse with White nationalism Its is an accusation thrown at anyone who wants to protect White culture which is not allowed in our biased society All other cultures can protect and advocate for themselves Whites create the freest and most diverse societies on planet Earth Whites created democracy and Liberalism and have the greatest legacy of freedom of any people Whites were the first people to end slavery in all their lands Slavery still exist on all other continents today Whites created the United Nations which give all nations a say supremacists do not do this There is however such a thing as Jewish Supremacy and the owner of the Patriots is Jewish And Jews are not European they are Middle Eastern and Semites Wake up people to the Zionist threat that is ruling over you	2018-02-04T02:55:52.000Z	Comment	7-djAvJsblE	Superbowl LI was RIGGED for your entertainment

You are silly video producer Without knowing what the blocking scheme was if the quarterback called an audible if the running back made a mistake and tried to recover if the back was supposed to block to the left but the Patriots ran a stunt This is the problem with so many people that publish information you have no clue what you are speaking about Without knowing what the offense or defense had planned and if the players actually did what they were supposed to but you jump to all kinds of assumptions It is like blaming someone for accidentally dropping a glass of water because they should have know that it was going to happen	2018-01-30T17:23:25.000Z	Comment	7-djAvJsblE	Superbowl LI was RIGGED for your entertainment

even though I m a niners fan this will probably go down as one of the greatest super bowls in history feel really bad for Atlanta though that is a tough way to lose being up by points with less than minutes in the rd quarter	2017-02-13T14:47:43.000Z	Comment	WdoaY5mOJQU	Super Bowl 51 Highlights (HD)

There is no more fun in football there is one clear cut best player best team best coach best defense best offence best organization That is the patriots of you disagree its not opinion anymore you are just wrong Every other dynasty super bowl winner QB coach are not even half as good as those with the patriots now its a fact not an opinion anymore And with the interest in football declining i doubt it will ever get any better I hate the patriots but at this point its true They are the best to ever do it no team or organization will ever come close that is why this game ruined football for me Had to get that off my chest Now tell me i am stupid or whatever have fun ripping me a new one	2017-02-08T23:49:43.000Z	Comment	WdoaY5mOJQU	Super Bowl 51 Highlights (HD)
Okay get ready for complaints This highlight video SUCKS DAY NO SHOWER DOUBLE DISHWASHING SHIFTS MEXICAN ASS How are you not going to show Ryan s sack after that amazing Julio Jones catch at the give or take How the fuck do you not add that into this video It s the catalyst factor of the entire game If they were the least bit smart and HAD shown it we d be able to see one of the dumbest play calls since Seattle s in SB Pats sure do luck out on those Goes to show what an AMATEUR ATL s coach is when that happened I m telling ya as soon as they saw Matt Ryan line up in the shotgun after that catch I ll bet you the thousand dollars that I don t have that at that exact moment Belicheck whispered to Brady we won You run the ball get a few yards eat up the clock forcing NE to use us their timeouts then kick the field goal and you re almost set Almost Not definitely but better than a one score game ATL s coach should be ashamed of himself for even thinking otherwise And if that wasn t bad enough then he goes on to waste a time out on Edelman s catch which was clearly a catch Now here s where I ll ask all of you idiot mopey Bahstin fucks to shut it The Falcons deserved to lose this game hands down But I ve been saying it for years one day there s gonna be a SB where a coin toss will decide the winner And that s exactly what happened Why in the world would there not be fair ups Or maybe even make it so that if you do score a TD on the first drive after you ve won the coin toss then if you go for two and get it it s game over If you do the extra point then the other team deserves fair ups That s a stupid fucking rule which makes absolutely no sense And my proposal isn t great either but it s better than winning a SB by a simple flip of a fucking coin Congrats to the Pats on the comeback Very ATL to blow that lead Not so much this season but how many seasons in the past decade have the Falcons came out going then ending the season at A bunch of times I ve always said the Falcons are a joke of a franchise and this seals the deal on that Thanks for literally handing the pats their th SB ATL you are now officially hated by the entire football loving world I m a Steelers fan and it sucked to lose to the pats in the AFC championship game but at least we got beat straight up And we ve won and been to so many SB s that I can live with what happened ATL face facts here You ll never win a SB You re a garbage team and franchise and all you can do is hang your two or three NFC Champions titles in the rafters to be sad about La hoo zeh her	2017-02-08T22:44:44.000Z	Comment	WdoaY5mOJQU	Super Bowl 51 Highlights (HD)
