Unbelievable how quickly Brady makes the read of who will be open first on this play He notices everyone is pressing so I m assuming whatever he s yelling is telling the receivers hey just try and beat your man and I m going to get it over their head And it s amazing how quickly he finds the man first off the ball and how perfectly it s placed	Ugz2kP6YsMOoSq_TJMZ4AaABAg	2018-10-20T18:51:37.000Z	Comment	udimh5GEiJI	Superbowl 51 Second Half 2017

as a livelong Pats fan and as a transplanted Falcon fan for over years this was my dream Super Bowl The Falcons made the Pats look old and slow for almost quarters Some factors happened that were beyond the Falcons control but the simple fact is they choked The saddest part among many is the Julio miracle grab and the calls afterward The Falcons gave up a ton of draft capital for Julio to make that play at that moment And he did Matt Bryant had not missed inside yards the entire season You run the ball three times and if you must throw quick hitch screen with no deep drop It s like teams forget simple fundamentals when faced with the Pats And the coaching staff went braindead But all of that aside a simply amazing performance by the Pats Brady had to be perfect and from onward he was Edelman s catch was one in a million And what can you say about Hightower the big sack this Super Bowl and the full body sacrifice bringing down Lynch the play before Butler s miracle Amazing joy at the Pats win and crushing grief at another Falcon choke Did I say this was my dream Super Bowl	Ugz7CI2ykNl6xJ8oOJB4AaABAg	2018-12-08T00:59:49.000Z	Comment	gY8exXZgyqc	Relive the Patriots' Amazing 25 point comeback in Super Bowl LI

You ask any coach in the NFL and they ll tell you that they d rather put the ball in the hands of their MVP quarterback instead of their kicker Vinateri and Gostkowski two of the all time greats both missed several field goals in the Super Bowl It was not at all as bad as you say and in fact if the OLineman didn t hold which didn t even affect the play that catch on the drive you are referring to would ve put them in field goal range Also don t give me this bullshit about should ve been picked off You want to talk about hypotheticals Wes Welker should ve and could ve EASILY made that catch in the Super Bowl The Patriots DLinemen and linebackers should pulled Eli down but he stayed up miraculously despite being grabbed and hit over and over on the Tyree catch Those two plays would give Brady two more rings Brady got as much credit as he deserved You don t throw for yards without your tight end and a running back as your leading receiver and get too much credit	UgwUr0JKa_1Mp8GNCS14AaABAg.8kDWb-NSPUd8m98FeQ3LDi	2018-10-08T18:12:15.000Z	Reply	_QSbRqHa7qc	Super Bowl 51 New England Patriots Vs Atlanta Falcons Condensed game Full Game

Also to the idiots that complain Manning had better receivers than Brady that is not the case Both QBs had Welker Brady had two of the best although not at the same time in Gronk and Moss Manning s top two receivers were Reggie Wayne and Marvin Harrison If you look at who each man has had on offense its about even And BOTH qbs were famous for turning an average receiver into a household name Dallas Clark did not do shit on any of the teams he was on after Manning Brandon Stokely was the same case Deion Branch was one of the receivers that Brady made So Peyton had two hall of fame receivers and so did Brady the way I see it Peyton had no hall of famers on the offense he played for in Denver And before someone slams me for calling Gronk a receiver he catches footballs I realize he plays tight end but that is still a receiver Tight ends hardly ever block anymore in today s NFL All they do is go out for passes typically But Gronk is that rare tight end in today s game that is an excellent blocker as well He may be the best tight end in NFL history	Ugy2sFWXoLfhMs3-i7t4AaABAg	2018-11-13T19:59:15.000Z	Comment	TDrX9f1c3Qw	Peytons Super Bowl party gone bad

I mean after this super bowl I think everyone really started to look passed all the little stupid things I just loved the way he was with his kids and family especially because of the condition of his mom and to come away with the theme there is always a way out and I think that s why Brady was more teary than jacked like his other superbowls G o a t a bears fan	UggTJQIq_0lGxngCoAEC	2017-05-14T15:06:07.000Z	Comment	kCprSa40f-Y	Best of Super Bowl 51 Mic'd Up

I am so glad that White dragged Allen s No ass into the end zone cause it was Allen that was pile driving Edelman into the ground earlier in the game So when Allen tried to tackle White on the last play of overtime and White dragged his ass into the end zone to win the game it just made me feel all warm and fuzzy	Ughn3_BmfdBDcXgCoAEC	2017-04-23T00:10:22.000Z	Comment	kCprSa40f-Y	Best of Super Bowl 51 Mic'd Up

There is no such thing as White Supremacy it is propaganda do not confuse with White nationalism Its is an accusation thrown at anyone who wants to protect White culture which is not allowed in our biased society All other cultures can protect and advocate for themselves Whites create the freest and most diverse societies on planet Earth Whites created democracy and Liberalism and have the greatest legacy of freedom of any people Whites were the first people to end slavery in all their lands Slavery still exist on all other continents today Whites created the United Nations which give all nations a say supremacists do not do this There is however such a thing as Jewish Supremacy and the owner of the Patriots is Jewish And Jews are not European they are Middle Eastern and Semites Wake up people to the Zionist threat that is ruling over you	UgwVNhM_7iMmf_aQ5Tl4AaABAg	2018-02-04T02:55:52.000Z	Comment	7-djAvJsblE	Superbowl LI was RIGGED for your entertainment

You are silly video producer Without knowing what the blocking scheme was if the quarterback called an audible if the running back made a mistake and tried to recover if the back was supposed to block to the left but the Patriots ran a stunt This is the problem with so many people that publish information you have no clue what you are speaking about Without knowing what the offense or defense had planned and if the players actually did what they were supposed to but you jump to all kinds of assumptions It is like blaming someone for accidentally dropping a glass of water because they should have know that it was going to happen	Ugyno7UA01b4h9ZA_LZ4AaABAg	2018-01-30T17:23:25.000Z	Comment	7-djAvJsblE	Superbowl LI was RIGGED for your entertainment
