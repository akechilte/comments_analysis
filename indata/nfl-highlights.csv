I really feel bad for packers fans This is coming from a jaguars fan and I have to say that a lot of packers fans that I see and meet are very nice and have good sportsmanship and based on what I ve seen most packers fans that post comments on their video are really pissed at their team but they don t rip on the opposing teams so to all of you people who talk trash about the packers for making excuses or being salty stop because you re the ones who are salty and you just want to make the packers fans feel bad I don t care if you have some kind of salty response just because you re a delusional jerk who is full of them self stfu about the packers sucking because they do right now but I think packers fans get it by now Also stop thinking that rodgers is the only reason for the packers losing all the time he pulls off great plays and personally I think he is definitly a great quarterback because he is able to make awesome plays I wish Blake Bortles was just like Rodgers Brady Brees Matt Ryan or hell even Josh Rosen because Josh Rosen did play well but anyways I just hope us fans can be civil just like our favorite NFL teams	2018-12-05T19:59:44.000Z	Comment	3cl7Fk9KoTc	Cardinals vs. Packers Week 13 Highlights | NFL 2018
