So after tax in canadian dollars your looking at close to for the GB and for the GB to basically have Netflix in theater screen size and few other social media apps seems pricey and gimmicky Your probably better going for Rift or HTC if you re really wanting the VR experience and just spending abit more Least with that there s the option of decent games to justify the cost plus not worrying on if you decided on the GB vs GB	2018-12-04T01:00:50.000Z	Comment	aQcR1q35vMc	Oculus Go VR Headset Review!

My favorite thing about this movie is the minimalist cast Unlike most horror movies they didn t have people running around just so they can have of them die gratuitous deaths keeping around for the climax It s just a story about a brother and his sister trying to come to terms with the death of their parents	2018-10-31T05:25:23.000Z	Comment	dYJrxezWLUk	Oculus Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Karen Gillan Horror Movie HD

How to prepare for paranormal activity and still screw up I only watched it just now and I understand why the movie is so controversial It doesn t matter wether the movie is about how far the paranormal could potentially push a person to lose grip on reality I just didn t feel the movie Ultimately it doesn t matter how much a movie exploits a potentiality if one doesn t enjoy watching it Rest is a SPOILER so be warned Would you seriously just assume you re conjuring up your fiancee and just stab him in the neck with a glass shard without checking first blindly assuming its an hallucination When you re even remotely an out of the box thinker you should ve figured that the mirror could do things you wouldn t be able to predict Even when they realized it could temporarily have them perform activities they weren t aware of they still CHOSE to stick around Its one thing to be stuck in a brilliant illusion its another thing to simply make stupid decisions Like many horrors I feel their choices just didn t make sense Many times one of the most frustrating things is that horrors contain characters that are either stupid or mentally weak I love the occasional strong character that fights back I thought it would happen in this movie but it didn t Pointless ending making the boy end up back where he started However one wants to sugarcoat how brilliantly this movie is it was just frustrating for me to watch The frustrating part was partly in the truth of how society works If you remember something correctly but something that most people can t accept they ll just shrink you down and make you swallow enough pills until you re acceptable for the rest of society We will only believe your story if its within our paradigm of what we re comfortable with So yeah lucky boy At the end of the movie he now knows whats in store for him Screw the truth we have pills to adjust your truth	2018-10-18T01:12:55.000Z	Comment	dYJrxezWLUk	Oculus Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Karen Gillan Horror Movie HD

I ve been slowly easing my toe into the hot water bath of VR as these past few years have gone by I don t have a ton of money so the Rift was never an option for me I enjoyed VR experiences on my smartphone on a cheap o headset but wasn t crazy about it I bought a Samsung Galaxy S specifically so I could also buy the Samsung Gear VR which is still my current VR headset Additionally the Oculus Go just didn t excite me enough to want to blow money on it This Oculus Quest sounds like it ll be right in my sweet spot I think I can handle the price tag Kind of steep but I know I can get the funds together Plus it sounds like it will have much more fulfilling gaming ability than the rather passive dwarfish VR gaming experiences the Samsung Gear VR provides To sum up I believe I ll subscribe to the Goldilocks idea of the Quest Not too hot like the Rift s lofty price not too cold like the somewhat mealy offerings of the Go but juuuuust the right mixed amount of manageable price and fuller fun I would put myself in the probably category when it comes to chance of pre ordering the Oculus Quest P S Thanks for the informative fun preview of the Quest F CEpa m x	2018-12-02T01:40:06.000Z	Comment	u8QRdpgRH7c	OCULUS QUEST | All specs explained, EVERYTHING we know + will it be worth it?

You re reasoning is a little off there mate and I d say the exact opposite what you re saying is true Just because GO doesn t access Android zone though you can sideload almost any GearVR app easily and buy a lot natively on the GO or play PC games which you still may be able to do with a free casting app like Riftcat doesn t mean the content won t be good Nintendo Switch doesn t play Wii games nor does it play ds games And the Vita doesn t play PlayStation games nor does it play PSP games Neither of those cases mean that those companies aren t focused on content for their device in fact the exact opposite of that is true Oculus will be focused heavily on content I m not sure what would make anyone think otherwise especially given their work with Rift	2018-12-05T23:41:06.000Z	Reply	u8QRdpgRH7c	OCULUS QUEST All specs explained EVERYTHING we know will it be worth it Best Wireless VR

Art Sin oddly enough I never truly got a good D effect out of games till the Nintendo DS but that may have to do with the fabled sweet spot as in I can selectively move my head closet or further away as the D is recombined on the screen and not relying on my crappy eyes to do it up close with goggles glasses Since now I know how D is SUPPOSED to feel in games I found the whole vr thing pretty Meh when trying out things like cardboard and vive other people got this incredible D headwrapping experience to immerse them Meanwhile my experience was really just a strange D looking headwrap and me just worrying I wasn t going to run into anything instead of enjoying the experience	2016-12-11T13:22:09.000Z	Reply	tPdp23gfbE0	Oculus Touch Controllers Review
xShadowDarkX Sorry to learn about your astigmatism I have a friend with one eye bit still feels immersed when playing his rift His reality is not seeing in d in the first place I take this is similar to your case its all relative to what you can see by default I tale even normal flatscreen would look a bit weird too	2016-12-11T12:12:47.000Z	Reply	tPdp23gfbE0	Oculus Touch Controllers Review
Art Sin doubtful I ve got a pretty bad stigmatism and D effects from movies to gaming have been all but wasted on me This is why vr to me is really nothing but an over glorified paper bag over the head experience of gaming all it really is without the D is a head wrap and typically bad graphics lol but I ll definitely take the head tracking and these new motion controllers for sure THATS my king of immersion	2016-12-10T22:10:17.000Z	Reply	tPdp23gfbE0	Oculus Touch Controllers Review

This looks fantastic The crate system reminds me a lot of Borderlands It killed me that no one I ve watched play this has used the forgrip on any of the guns When you were trying to dismantle the first time you accidentally grabbed the forgrip and you can see the gun extends from an smg style more to a combat rifle style	2018-12-05T01:41:36.000Z	Comment	TFLdFoTtu6o	Stormland Oculus Rift Gameplay - Oculus Connect 5

Smockster I agree with you and I m a rift user however oculus function is different with the index and thumb features but they could come up with simple way around that The only thing I can think of is they are different sets of hardware and Oculus wants to make sure it performs the best it can Developers of course are going to put the effort where the money is Oculus pays a lot of money for these AAA titles because simply put VR isn t a cash cow at the moment I m really hoping oculus quest brings more people into VR and once they experience that they will want more I want VR to succeed because flat TV gaming is a yawn fest to me	2018-10-27T09:53:17.000Z	Reply	TFLdFoTtu6o	Stormland Oculus Rift Gameplay Oculus Connect

Good Video it shows how far VR has come in the last two years For my first VR headset I wanted the Odyssey but i couldn t find anywhere that would let me import it i m from UK at a reasonable price even on black Friday so rather than spend i got the original Odyssey for and its miles better than the Rift and Vive visually as you demonstrate and dare i say it its not far off the Plus The SDE is only noticeable on large white flat areas I m an old fart in feb and it blew me away it was so intense an experience it brought to mind my experiences in the s with certain Party drugs FFS i fell over playing Beat Sabre trying to duck under the flying wall thing Amazing But my next headset will be at least K K even better inside out tracking and cordless I cant be dealing with light towers base stations and wires are so last century Samsung are on to a winner with the Odyssey and with what seems to be the same lenses as the Vive pro which is over twice the cost If Oculus and HTC dont get there acts together in the next months i can see them going to the wall	2018-12-05T18:49:49.000Z	Comment	XcaoZ7M0JY8	THROUGH THE LENSES - SAMSUNG ODYSSEY + PLUS vs OCULUS RIFT vs  HTC VIVE GearVR Mod

Ive just swapped from the Rift to O I loved my Rift but the O is so much better for image quality I appreciate is hard to take video and photo through the lens the O looks much better in real life On the contrary to some reviews the image is just as sharp as the Rift but with all the added benefits of extra detail view distance etc	2018-12-05T11:28:04.000Z	Comment	XcaoZ7M0JY8	THROUGH THE LENSES - SAMSUNG ODYSSEY + PLUS vs OCULUS RIFT vs  HTC VIVE GearVR Mod

Great Comparision My Odyssey arrived a few days ago First the negative things Cable ist too short and too much light from outside through the lenses But this can be fixed easily Now the good part the display quality is great Just the enjoyable and clear view i wished i had on the old vive I truely recommend this device For example playing the lab where you stand on top of a mountain Looking at the distance with my old vive you can only see something that looks like mountains between a pixel meeting With the Odyssey plus you can just sit down and enjoy the mountains and the horizon I love it But an additional Meter extension for USB and HDMI is a must have for room scale	2018-12-04T23:30:13.000Z	Comment	XcaoZ7M0JY8	THROUGH THE LENSES - SAMSUNG ODYSSEY + PLUS vs OCULUS RIFT vs  HTC VIVE GearVR Mod

This would be a lot more useful if each headset used optimised settings hardware and game settings For example the Rift with SS uses about the same resources as the O SS and the result is not too much different Also I find that in dark space games simulators I get a better result with my Rift with Spud turned off Still nice out of box comparison though thanks	2018-12-04T21:47:00.000Z	Comment	XcaoZ7M0JY8	THROUGH THE LENSES - SAMSUNG ODYSSEY + PLUS vs OCULUS RIFT vs  HTC VIVE GearVR Mod

Yeah I have both and and find the tracing a bit annoying at times with certain games Longbow Space Pirate Trainer I also find the audio of the Odyssey considerably worse that my Vive with DAS I m using an extension cable and I was recently told that s probably the reason by my audio sometimes goes haywire and becomes loud static Maybe when get a USB cable for my Vive ballot box and use that too boost the signal to my Odyssey the audio will be less bad But I don t remember it being better when I first tried it without the extension so I doubt I ll be impressed with the audio	2018-12-05T05:25:14.000Z	Reply	XcaoZ7M0JY8	THROUGH THE LENSES SAMSUNG ODYSSEY PLUS vs OCULUS RIFT vs HTC VIVE GearVR Mod

To be honest the solution to your problem is simpler than a harness or neck sensor or whatever you can simply code a quick fix by drawing a vector between the head and directional hand and use that vector for movement that way you re dependent on your hand position but not rotation I created that system in Pathmaker	2018-10-17T09:51:19.000Z	Comment	lZVTaTleohs	Skyrim VR (Oculus Rift) #1 : Good or Bad?

Why not just have the orientation be something you set manually Like point your controller where you want to orient forwards and press a button and it save that orientation To me that sounds like a good temporary solution All you need to do when moving your thumb stick is keep in mind where you set your orientation	2018-10-01T03:19:12.000Z	Comment	lZVTaTleohs	Skyrim VR (Oculus Rift) #1 : Good or Bad?

Gopher isn t running any mods in this video But most texture mods should work and mesh replacements shouldn t have issues The big thing you would need to look out for are hud and ui mods and stuff that uses the MCM might not work or maybe there is a solution for it now I don t have VR so i wouldn t know I am sure there is more detailed lists of what kinds of mods work and don t work in VR on reddit or something	2018-10-01T03:24:09.000Z	Reply	lZVTaTleohs	Skyrim VR Oculus Rift Good or Bad
