What I want is a VR AR headset which allows me to monitor a x array multi screen and switch screens between some kind of go to my PC and or wireless security cams with audio so I can go about my business around my home office or back yard and still watch and hear all the streaming webinars cablecasts of various television shows and radio broadcasts along with any phone calls text messages see out the windows or spot anyone who rings the doorbell Some kind of neural frequency multiplexer would be nice too That way I could possibly use brain wave entrainment technology to hopefully assimilate all the information in a pulsed packet form of some kind Call it a hyper focused self hypnotic state if you will A bite tube controlled coffee dispenser might come in handy as well but not a deal killer I d even pay full retail for the entire package if it worked and didn t cause cancer	UgwIBcF-4J9UPLwnBoZ4AaABAg	2018-12-07T04:41:13.000Z	Comment	aQcR1q35vMc	Oculus Go VR Headset Review!

So after tax in canadian dollars your looking at close to for the GB and for the GB to basically have Netflix in theater screen size and few other social media apps seems pricey and gimmicky Your probably better going for Rift or HTC if you re really wanting the VR experience and just spending abit more Least with that there s the option of decent games to justify the cost plus not worrying on if you decided on the GB vs GB	UgwZfHkr3H8N5GUcNxB4AaABAg	2018-12-04T01:00:50.000Z	Comment	aQcR1q35vMc	Oculus Go VR Headset Review!

My favorite thing about this movie is the minimalist cast Unlike most horror movies they didn t have people running around just so they can have of them die gratuitous deaths keeping around for the climax It s just a story about a brother and his sister trying to come to terms with the death of their parents	UgxxM9dtL2KDKEwdgMJ4AaABAg	2018-10-31T05:25:23.000Z	Comment	dYJrxezWLUk	Oculus Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Karen Gillan Horror Movie HD

How to prepare for paranormal activity and still screw up I only watched it just now and I understand why the movie is so controversial It doesn t matter wether the movie is about how far the paranormal could potentially push a person to lose grip on reality I just didn t feel the movie Ultimately it doesn t matter how much a movie exploits a potentiality if one doesn t enjoy watching it Rest is a SPOILER so be warned Would you seriously just assume you re conjuring up your fiancee and just stab him in the neck with a glass shard without checking first blindly assuming its an hallucination When you re even remotely an out of the box thinker you should ve figured that the mirror could do things you wouldn t be able to predict Even when they realized it could temporarily have them perform activities they weren t aware of they still CHOSE to stick around Its one thing to be stuck in a brilliant illusion its another thing to simply make stupid decisions Like many horrors I feel their choices just didn t make sense Many times one of the most frustrating things is that horrors contain characters that are either stupid or mentally weak I love the occasional strong character that fights back I thought it would happen in this movie but it didn t Pointless ending making the boy end up back where he started However one wants to sugarcoat how brilliantly this movie is it was just frustrating for me to watch The frustrating part was partly in the truth of how society works If you remember something correctly but something that most people can t accept they ll just shrink you down and make you swallow enough pills until you re acceptable for the rest of society We will only believe your story if its within our paradigm of what we re comfortable with So yeah lucky boy At the end of the movie he now knows whats in store for him Screw the truth we have pills to adjust your truth	UgzkcTrV0rgEgFDJ-w14AaABAg	2018-10-18T01:12:55.000Z	Comment	dYJrxezWLUk	Oculus Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Karen Gillan Horror Movie HD

I ve been slowly easing my toe into the hot water bath of VR as these past few years have gone by I don t have a ton of money so the Rift was never an option for me I enjoyed VR experiences on my smartphone on a cheap o headset but wasn t crazy about it I bought a Samsung Galaxy S specifically so I could also buy the Samsung Gear VR which is still my current VR headset Additionally the Oculus Go just didn t excite me enough to want to blow money on it This Oculus Quest sounds like it ll be right in my sweet spot I think I can handle the price tag Kind of steep but I know I can get the funds together Plus it sounds like it will have much more fulfilling gaming ability than the rather passive dwarfish VR gaming experiences the Samsung Gear VR provides To sum up I believe I ll subscribe to the Goldilocks idea of the Quest Not too hot like the Rift s lofty price not too cold like the somewhat mealy offerings of the Go but juuuuust the right mixed amount of manageable price and fuller fun I would put myself in the probably category when it comes to chance of pre ordering the Oculus Quest P S Thanks for the informative fun preview of the Quest F CEpa m x	Ugzn_3ERdRuv3syN_hB4AaABAg	2018-12-02T01:40:06.000Z	Comment	u8QRdpgRH7c	OCULUS QUEST | All specs explained, EVERYTHING we know + will it be worth it?

You re reasoning is a little off there mate and I d say the exact opposite what you re saying is true Just because GO doesn t access Android zone though you can sideload almost any GearVR app easily and buy a lot natively on the GO or play PC games which you still may be able to do with a free casting app like Riftcat doesn t mean the content won t be good Nintendo Switch doesn t play Wii games nor does it play ds games And the Vita doesn t play PlayStation games nor does it play PSP games Neither of those cases mean that those companies aren t focused on content for their device in fact the exact opposite of that is true Oculus will be focused heavily on content I m not sure what would make anyone think otherwise especially given their work with Rift	Ugx3IHK7YCpnAbYD8VF4AaABAg.8oUsAtqr0rQ8oV3zzmiom4	2018-12-05T23:41:06.000Z	Reply	u8QRdpgRH7c	OCULUS QUEST | All specs explained, EVERYTHING we know + will it be worth it?

Hey I have a question about the audio when it comes to watching movies in a theater setting So is the audio standard like when you are watching a regular video through headphones or does it actually have the surround sound feel to them like in a real movie theater	UgyaYVX2QIaW8SWLhv14AaABAg	2018-12-05T05:33:46.000Z	Comment	szwMfvCVIxQ	Virtual Desktop Oculus Go!

would it be possible to just get a spare router without an ethernet connection and just only plug your pc in and then connect your go this way you will have almost no interference from other devices because i have tried using a steam link over our home wifi and that didn t work that well it will of course not be ideal because you can t really access the internet but for playing offline games and watching movies this would be great	UgxCJXsl37EJCJgXcFB4AaABAg	2018-12-04T18:22:11.000Z	Comment	szwMfvCVIxQ	Virtual Desktop Oculus Go!

This very well done video touches on a recent concern of mine I just bought a VR ready computer with a card Would have preferred the but not enuf right now I was leaning towards getting the Samsung Odyssey PLUS headset because the reviews just raved about the display quality which many felt far exceeded the Rift s BUT the Rift has many other compelling features like the controllers tracking etc Then I spent some time in the Oculus Steam stores and one of my very favorite games jumped out at me and now in a VR version namely LA Noire I was SO pumped until I realized it needed a card Grrrr But my main concern is that Oculus has changed its marketing focus so frequently that it seems like the mid range gamer is going to get left in the dust Oculus Go is great if you want a relaxed entree to VR untethered no cell phone necessary to power the device and enuf moderately amusing games to keep a newbie entertained while lying on the couch watching a movie with a beer in hand Yawn So I was praying that the Oculus Quest would have a display like the Samsung Plus while retaining the superior tracking of the Rift Strike out again I don t want my initial experiences in VR to consist of playing arcade like games or even more superior ones that always miss the mark because there doesn t seem to be a manufacturer out there who can put these components together in a logical fashion I realize these comments are a little outside your main point but if there is anyone who can understand my dilemma and suggest where I may be missing the boat this group seems likely to be able to offer some valuable insights Lastly what a blast it was watching you in the cockpit of that plane you hadn t flown in a couple of years What a show	UgzFe3RHL3kTazsxR5N4AaABAg	2018-12-06T02:57:01.000Z	Comment	Sz9bgbknBus	Oculus Rift: Long Term Review

Art Sin that s fair enough I d rather just not waste too much into the whole vr scene as is and maybe see if it becomes more commercially accepted available or if the head tracking stays and the need for the headset recedes but those controllers are damn awesome though	UgiGnht98XmOgHgCoAEC.8M9BmQdCyeF8MLptxMeKtL	2016-12-11T14:25:36.000Z	Reply	tPdp23gfbE0	Oculus Touch Controllers Review

Art Sin oddly enough I never truly got a good D effect out of games till the Nintendo DS but that may have to do with the fabled sweet spot as in I can selectively move my head closet or further away as the D is recombined on the screen and not relying on my crappy eyes to do it up close with goggles glasses Since now I know how D is SUPPOSED to feel in games I found the whole vr thing pretty Meh when trying out things like cardboard and vive other people got this incredible D headwrapping experience to immerse them Meanwhile my experience was really just a strange D looking headwrap and me just worrying I wasn t going to run into anything instead of enjoying the experience	UgiGnht98XmOgHgCoAEC.8M9BmQdCyeF8MLid9cLScZ	2016-12-11T13:22:09.000Z	Reply	tPdp23gfbE0	Oculus Touch Controllers Review
xShadowDarkX Sorry to learn about your astigmatism I have a friend with one eye bit still feels immersed when playing his rift His reality is not seeing in d in the first place I take this is similar to your case its all relative to what you can see by default I tale even normal flatscreen would look a bit weird too	UgiGnht98XmOgHgCoAEC.8M9BmQdCyeF8MLah4Sg1oG	2016-12-11T12:12:47.000Z	Reply	tPdp23gfbE0	Oculus Touch Controllers Review
Art Sin doubtful I ve got a pretty bad stigmatism and D effects from movies to gaming have been all but wasted on me This is why vr to me is really nothing but an over glorified paper bag over the head experience of gaming all it really is without the D is a head wrap and typically bad graphics lol but I ll definitely take the head tracking and these new motion controllers for sure THATS my king of immersion	UgiGnht98XmOgHgCoAEC.8M9BmQdCyeF8MK5HSzl90A	2016-12-10T22:10:17.000Z	Reply	tPdp23gfbE0	Oculus Touch Controllers Review

Smockster I agree with you and I m a rift user however oculus function is different with the index and thumb features but they could come up with simple way around that The only thing I can think of is they are different sets of hardware and Oculus wants to make sure it performs the best it can Developers of course are going to put the effort where the money is Oculus pays a lot of money for these AAA titles because simply put VR isn t a cash cow at the moment I m really hoping oculus quest brings more people into VR and once they experience that they will want more I want VR to succeed because flat TV gaming is a yawn fest to me	Ugx1kskxwvx0X54McA14AaABAg.8mQpFrxp_t_8muAFrXYN4q	2018-10-27T09:53:17.000Z	Reply	TFLdFoTtu6o	Stormland Oculus Rift Gameplay - Oculus Connect 5

Good Video it shows how far VR has come in the last two years For my first VR headset I wanted the Odyssey but i couldn t find anywhere that would let me import it i m from UK at a reasonable price even on black Friday so rather than spend i got the original Odyssey for and its miles better than the Rift and Vive visually as you demonstrate and dare i say it its not far off the Plus The SDE is only noticeable on large white flat areas I m an old fart in feb and it blew me away it was so intense an experience it brought to mind my experiences in the s with certain Party drugs FFS i fell over playing Beat Sabre trying to duck under the flying wall thing Amazing But my next headset will be at least K K even better inside out tracking and cordless I cant be dealing with light towers base stations and wires are so last century Samsung are on to a winner with the Odyssey and with what seems to be the same lenses as the Vive pro which is over twice the cost If Oculus and HTC dont get there acts together in the next months i can see them going to the wall	Ugx3YhdQCvlmRDWBaet4AaABAg	2018-12-05T18:49:49.000Z	Comment	XcaoZ7M0JY8	THROUGH THE LENSES - SAMSUNG ODYSSEY + PLUS vs OCULUS RIFT vs  HTC VIVE GearVR Mod
