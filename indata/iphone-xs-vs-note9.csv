This guy he says somethings that are contradictory to what he was saying like the stereo speakers what dose that have to do with the headphone jack And then he brings up how the power is on the phones and then talks about how Apple is extremely strong but mentions memory for no reason and says it s a draw when clearly it isn t just saying there is a lot of biased going on here	UgxGkwyAFrJ0s1Gd9j14AaABAg	2018-12-06T21:37:32.000Z	Comment	KOq8yQ0UzQM	Galaxy Note 9 vs iPhone Xs Max - Full Comparison (Extended)

Been using the note since late October and this is easily the best phone I have ever used it s snappy it has tons of features the camera is great in most situations it s a phone what do you expect the battery life is amazing compared to every other phone I ve had screen is amazing this is the first phone I actually want to game on the tall screen makes a world of difference hands down an amazing phone But it all depends on your preferences some people like the simplicity of apple some like me like the customization of Android and features it has No point in fanboying to either side I ve never owned an iPhone but I don t have a problem with them Just choose the device your happy with and the device that suits your needs	UgwSulbeydqSidlQxkl4AaABAg	2018-11-26T20:28:47.000Z	Comment	o42Shm7FyQo	Galaxy Note 9 vs iPhone XS Max: Which is Worth Your $1,000?

The note and max are on par for hardware Software it s a different story you can t beat iOS I ve used different android phones over the years and I used to be a fandroid bashing iPhones left and right then switched to an iPhone one day just to try it out and now I can t go back The ease of use on iOS is incredible the features work all the time I like android don t get me wrong was very tempted to get one recently but I don t care about customization which is all android has over iOS years in and my iPhone is actually faster than when I got it due to iOS All I can do is thank android for the great competition it s put on apple to improve iPhone hardware and software	Ugx2cYO252n18ut_6Nh4AaABAg	2018-11-16T16:47:22.000Z	Comment	o42Shm7FyQo	Galaxy Note 9 vs iPhone XS Max: Which is Worth Your $1,000?

If the Iphone had a wireless charger and an ipen included it would be worth the price tag because these are missing i would go for the note clearly the apple iphone is more robust though better build but no headphone jack Note has a bigger battery If i would design a phone i would put the best features of both phones What is Apple waiting to make a phone with pen	Ugzq_YyRM2fmfeDaunx4AaABAg	2018-12-04T23:36:38.000Z	Comment	bXnPcyABPK0	iPhone XS Max vs Samsung Galaxy Note 9
I m a Samsung fan through and through I m still carrying the Note because I mean I absolutely fell in love with it I ve had a Apple phone hated it They re operating system sucks And being able to do additional stuff on your phone is very limited for me that s a no brainer but I m trying to wait for the Samsung Note to come out before I upgrade And to top that my girls have gone through two Apple phones cuz they crashed to the point that can recover them after a couple years So they upgraded because I had no other choice Fortunate for me we had the Jump program with T Mobile That s one thing I want to mention to anyone thinking about going to Apple that they don t last as long The battery after a year doesn t hold its charge as long as the Samsung	UgyJWsGpEH6raq9Jujt4AaABAg	2018-12-04T08:18:18.000Z	Comment	bXnPcyABPK0	iPhone XS Max vs Samsung Galaxy Note 9

I had an iPhone but moved onto Galaxy Note I hated the iPhone but love the iPad Pro For having both operating systems I have found out that IOS is superior in gaming and quality apps However the Note series is all about productivity I can get so much stuff done in no time I m currently using the iPad for making music but that s about it I m going to buy the Galaxy Tab S to go hand in hand with my Note for superior productivity I ll always use both operating systems because I do make music and enjoy gaming on IOS I need the unlimited possibilities with Android	Ugze9MW_b4Gxskc_uPR4AaABAg	2018-12-05T20:32:50.000Z	Comment	o1T9gjVWVv8	iPhone XS Max vs Galaxy Note 9 // The iPhone Wins!?

Ben Schipunov Isheep spotted S pen is advanced and it would take years for apple to get it to samsungs level if they wanted to implement it You say apple got rid of that years ago but that s bullshit It was nowhere close and apple couldnt make it work The fact is it s better when it s there even if you dont use it much Also apple was always behind Samsung in IP rating They just catched up this year Not for long tho i guess S and Note will completely destroy next Gen Iphone not to mention xs max Your argument that Iphone is more advanced is not valid at all Xs max is newer phone than Note When s comes out this Iphone will be miles behind and what you will say then	UgzdsF0fQrkPKUk6spl4AaABAg.8lsK3qhfLzq8m4cxtUKKn4	2018-10-07T00:13:05.000Z	Reply	g9sxh5GdLJQ	Should You Buy iPhone XS Max or Galaxy Note 9?

My wife has the iPhone Xs Max I have the note I m just going to say the note actually feels like it s worth the to me or depending on which storage option you go with The iPhone xs max on the other hand feels way over priced in my opinion I understand people say most phones are over priced but apple just over does it big time I mean for the gb option it will run you plus tax and they dont even give you the damn fast charger The note I can spend or take advantage of one of the great price saving deals out there and get the gb gb of ram with expandable storage It s a no brainer people For your money the note is the way to go Your getting much much more Also the beautiful Samsung display is great	UgxQBmkRpNk-IV7imnx4AaABAg	2018-12-07T02:42:49.000Z	Comment	wFAXPhG8Ps0	Apple iPhone XS Max vs Samsung Galaxy Note 9
What was the game ge was playing at oh and I am here because my mother has been telling me how she wants a better iPhone since i have my own cell phone service and currently have the Samsung forever plan through sprint i figured i would just get her a phone and add her to my plan but it s a Samsung only plan so I have been trying to see if apple makes a phone that is as practical for me to use on a daily basis like I do at school work and just about everywhere I go I literally use my note as my laptop in school i write all my papers on my phone i have all of my textbooks installed on my phone and on top of that I can pop out the S pen when I am taking notes from the lectures and write everything I need to and I to need a lb backpack I mean it s amazing I have all the schools printers connected to my phone so all I have to do is ask my instructor if I can just scan the handout she gives us with Adobe scanner it automatically converts the photo to a PDF then I use a pdf Spen pdf app and write on the homework in class assignment handouts and I can give the actual paper back to my instructor instead of mashing it in my bag or risk losing it I write and do everything I need on the scanned handout then save it to a specific file on my Google drive and voila I have it saved so I can access it from anywhere I need I truly believe I would not be able to do all of the things I do with my note on a apple iPhone I just love the versatility of Samsung Electronics they are always pushing themselves for the best and greatest I mean the Spen come on a damn pen inside of your phone Apple has a pen yes but the damn thing is huge and you cant carry it inside of your phone and I m sure it doesn t charge in seconds I just dont know what kind of Samsung phone to buy my mother yet she s not very tech savvy but she loves taking photos of the family and her grand kids and editing them the phone she has now has so many its bogged down and literally has not even one miniscule amount of space left She s a tiny woman at so big phones aren t very easy for her to work with Any suggestions	Ugze1E1NNqMC3Iz7JO14AaABAg	2018-12-07T02:22:12.000Z	Comment	wFAXPhG8Ps0	Apple iPhone XS Max vs Samsung Galaxy Note 9

The funny is that people don t understand how Android updates iOS Every security updates comes with a new OS number Even if the Phone is too old it will get few or none new features but a new OS number because of the security updates Android The phones will be stuck on a OS number either because the phone can t handle all features or some Or if the manufacturer stop supporting the model The phones will still recive new security updates but no new OS number Samsung in some crazy way Samsung manage to release new features that comes in a later Android update That means even if Samsung is slow on new android updates the phones will already have the features Like app split screen and so on The phones will still have the latest security update	UgzBtr9MD292YYWNfjh4AaABAg	2018-12-07T17:01:26.000Z	Comment	Tkflx0VHJWs	iPhone XS Max vs Note 9: The Experience After 2 Months

Nick Ackerman please report back on how your Note is performing in a year or two I have yet to see an Android device that doesn t suffer serious performance degradation after months I m not a fanboy or loyal to any one brand though If I am ever completely convinced that Android has left its performance issues behind then I would seriously consider switching back over again The iPhone is boring no doubt but at the end of the day IDGAF about bells and whistles if the phone is janky and glitching after months That s been my experience with every one of the Android devices I ve owned but I m hoping that changes some day Would love to have an interesting phone and OS and rock solid reliability	UgwVliinU8XXne8_M-14AaABAg.8mi84RMp0dJ8mtHyb3N60k	2018-10-27T01:41:28.000Z	Reply	jqwbWIQ7Je4	Why I'm Choosing Note 9 Over iPhone XS Max?

The extra ram really helps more for split screen multitasking popup windows and Dex support On my S plus I can watch YouTube and play games at the same time A reload doesn t bother me as load times are fast and you get the latest content which you would have to refresh anyway Kudos to Apple for finally getting it right as the Ram management on the X was terrible From what I ve seen in other test the Androids perform better via the recent app tabs than from the home screen And the point of OS preference holds true if you don t like IOS or vice versa does it really matter if you re not going to buy one If you were using both at the same time doing the sane things it would be the only time you might notice but nobody is using both at the same time doing the same thing apart from in toxic comparison videos that make YouTube a pretty unpleasant place to be a lot of the time	Ugw7WfZiMRqeF56XCP54AaABAg.8m8QyH-Oicq8m8V9_xXWdc	2018-10-08T12:13:09.000Z	Reply	Fc2RflSjfto	iPhone Xs Max 512GB vs Note 9 512GB Speed Test

Jakob warum soll der test unfair sein alter berleg mal wenn er das note auf fullhd setzt hat das xs max eine h here aufl sung somit kann man jz auch sagen es sei unfair das note hat ein kleineres display und mehr akkukapazit t wenn das nicht schon peinlich genug f r samsung sein sollte das das xs max genauso lang h lt vorallem im alltag l nger als das note nen freund hat es und sein akkustand sinkt schneller als meiner vorallem beim zocken	UgxjMVUsn1O_MH23jNB4AaABAg.8mL008_xPhr8mRPQYxlbCX	2018-10-15T20:28:36.000Z	Reply	AmEK6SZncAw	iPhone Xs Max vs Galaxy Note 9 - Was ist besser?

Ich habe jetzt schon einige Videos zum Note gesehen Habe es bevor ich es bestellt habe noch nicht in der Hand gehalten es ist wirklich riesig im vergleich zu denen die ich vorher hatte Aber ich verstehe beim besten willen nicht wie sich absolut jeder Smartphone Vloger ber den Fingerabdrucksensor aufregen kann Ich selbst komme wunderbar an den Sensor aber auch beim Note ist er f r mich pers nlich an einer guten stelle platziert Ich komme bei normaler handhabe mit dem Zeigefinger locker ber den oberen Smartphone Rand Aus diesem Grund bleibt nur eine M glichkeit Ihr habt sehr kleine H nde o	UgxjMVUsn1O_MH23jNB4AaABAg.8mL008_xPhr8mNG3D67B1z	2018-10-14T05:49:49.000Z	Reply	AmEK6SZncAw	iPhone Xs Max vs Galaxy Note 9 - Was ist besser?

Zu Beginn Vielen Dank f r deine M he und deine gute Qualit t Ich fand das Video gut gemacht und bin nat rlich nicht bei allen Punkten einverstanden Kann deine Begr ndungen jedoch verstehen Was ich nicht verstanden habe ist was die AppleWatch in diesem Video zu suchen hat Es beginnt ja beim S Pen welcher ja nur die Note Reihe von Samsung hat Das hast du ja auch gesagt Dann kommst du aber mit der AppleWatch und sagst das es momentan die beste SmartWatch ist und man kann sie nur mit eine iPhone nutzen Also das ist ein Argument f r das s Max Kannst du mir erkl ren wieso du diesen Sprung machst Ich k nnte es ja verstehen wenn der S Penslot im Note leer ist und man daf r extra einen S Pen kaufen m sste Dem ist aber nicht so Der S Pen geh rt zum Preis Die AppleWatch nicht Und das Problem ist das du ein ganz neues Fass aufmachst Nun k nnen wir ja mal sehen was es denn nur f r Apple und nur f r die Note gibt Da finden wir sicherlich vieles und wenn dann jedes f r nur dieses Smartphone sprechen w rde das ist doch ein Witz Aber du l sst das aller ausser Acht sagst das es ein Argument f r das sMax ist Und zu guter letzt gibst du beiden einen Punkt obwohl das Note viel mehr zus tzliches f r weniger zu bieten hat Das einzige womit Apple trumpfen kann ist das eigene Apple Universum dass jo so gut harmoniert Man bedenke auch hier Wieder alles Produkte die man nicht beim Kauf des besten iPhones erh lt Aus meiner Sicht also sicherlich keinen Punkt Und falls man das eben doch dazu z hlen m chte Dasselbe gibt es ja auch bei Samsung Die haben auch ihr eigenes Universum Mein Samsungfernseher kann ich auch nur mit meinem Note steuern Wie eine Vielzahl weiterer Produkte aus dem Hause Samsung Ich finde das so schade dass du aus meiner Sicht vieles vernachl ssigst oder nicht bis zu Ende gedacht hast Und zum Schluss der Preis Hier gehst du wieder nur auf das Produkt zur ck Doch gerade der Punkt Ausstattung welchen du beiden Smartphones je einen Punkt gibst wird es nicht gerecht Das Note hat keine Hilfe von zus tzlichen Ger ten erhalten Das iPhone aber massiv Dennoch ist es immer noch teurer und eine AppleWatch ist ja noch nicht dabei Und dann gibt es daf r keine Punkte D Also ich finde doch der Preis ist sehr wohl einen Punkt wert und dieser Punkt kann nat rlich nur an das Note gehen Es bietet f r seinen Preis doch einiges mehr und kostet doch einiges weniger Ah ich finde es so schade das du diesen Schritt nicht gewagt hast Aber dennoch ansonsten wieder ein tolles Video mit viel Qualit t Mir geht es auch nicht um dich fertig zu machen Daf r h tte es gereicht wenn ich etwas viel k rzeres verfasst h tte Ich hoffe du weisst was ich meine und ich weiss das du eben auch einer dieser YouTube bist der wirklich sagt was er denkt und sehr oft sehr objektiv bleibt	UgxjMVUsn1O_MH23jNB4AaABAg.8mL008_xPhr8mLT4IAAeoq	2018-10-13T13:05:05.000Z	Reply	AmEK6SZncAw	iPhone Xs Max vs Galaxy Note 9 - Was ist besser?

Great video Hand down the most accurate video comparing the two I was a iPhone user for years and then went to a note last year and just recently went back to an iPhone xs Max and now I m finding myself wanting to go back to the note only due to the multitasking and picture and picture Seriously Apple needs to tackle this head on and offer it in a new IOS update because this is killing me I m honestly considering returning my xs max due to this reason Do you see Apple offering this anytime soon	Ugye2qToZfIcJ8ON-bp4AaABAg	2018-11-10T02:11:10.000Z	Comment	BsMXPzszhYs	iPhone XS MAX vs Galaxy Note 9 part 2 Which has better User Experience

Having a note I see some of your points However one thing I d like to note is that it s so much easier to change up ring tones and notifications sounds on Android than on ios For instance I have zedge and can use that as well as my own music and sounds for ringtones and notifications On ios you have to download an app then have whatever music in Apple music most cases saved through iTunes to your phone download an app edit it through the app connect to the computer save the edit to the computer then resync it to iTunes back to the phone just to get the ring tone i want More than likely I lost you in step or lol But just sharing my experience from having an iPhone plus for almost a year when I got the note	UgxN6JhqzApl3JU01ep4AaABAg.8mETN8QJjQs8mOWuw4oGD7	2018-10-14T17:36:20.000Z	Reply	BsMXPzszhYs	iPhone XS MAX vs Galaxy Note 9 part 2 Which has better User Experience
I agree That s why the not so tech savvy can use an iPhone out the box with less issues Tech lovers like you and me know the beauty of Android and enjoy the features and freedom of it This is honestly why I use both simultaneously Best of both worlds	UgxN6JhqzApl3JU01ep4AaABAg.8mETN8QJjQs8mO19n3psdc	2018-10-14T12:58:53.000Z	Reply	BsMXPzszhYs	iPhone XS MAX vs Galaxy Note 9 part 2 Which has better User Experience
CJKnowsTECH iOS I ll admit is a genius idea the truth behind it is that your year old grandparents can use it just as a five year old can but give either an Android and they get confused because you have to think outside the box to use Android I for one not interested in fluid experience as much as productive features which I have on my Android it all balls down to do you want your phone limited Apple or do you want your phone opened and free Android	UgxN6JhqzApl3JU01ep4AaABAg.8mETN8QJjQs8mO0mgBnwK2	2018-10-14T12:55:35.000Z	Reply	BsMXPzszhYs	iPhone XS MAX vs Galaxy Note 9 part 2 Which has better User Experience

Heres my honest opinion I own the note and I still think the I phone XS max has a slightly better camera in my opinion the pixel is number one the I phone is number and Samsung is number and seeing how good smart phone cameras are it could be a th place camera and it would still be A GREAT camera still they re all close	UgzQPJUOO7Z_y0Amh_d4AaABAg	2018-10-31T11:39:18.000Z	Comment	kxNhL2ekzEI	iPhone Xs vs Samsung Galaxy Note 9 Camera Test!

Both phones are great for pictures I have a Note but the iPhone does well too I like that all brands are all stepping up and you can t go wrong with either The only thing I don t like is the front facing camera on both phones I love the sharpness and HDR plus of the nexus pixel devices in terms of front facing and low light quality	UgxTgzWxRsitQBR272F4AaABAg	2018-10-26T03:52:35.000Z	Comment	kxNhL2ekzEI	iPhone Xs vs Samsung Galaxy Note 9 Camera Test!

Subtle differences here and there all you need to differentiate the pictures is the warmer tones on the iphone along with maintaining great details in areas which on the note get lost in overexposure eg the girl holding the cup in one hand and the iphone in the other iphone has a warmer image and the cup is blown out in the note s image	Ugx0KHQxG9cd9Xv2UJR4AaABAg	2018-10-20T12:46:34.000Z	Comment	kxNhL2ekzEI	iPhone Xs vs Samsung Galaxy Note 9 Camera Test!

I LOVE APPLE DONT GET ME WRONG But the software itself is limiting shutting apps when it needs to so it wont consume much chip resource in the end apple is king on that alone But in real world test It won t mean a thing when both phones are comparable who care ones slightly faster Samsung has a mm chip while apple uses the mm chip and even then the Note was able to Keep up and in some parts out performed the IPhone Xs max	Ugxe0siZm-65rFcrpEV4AaABAg	2018-11-17T03:43:34.000Z	Comment	YGVBFQxTSgw	iPhone XS Max vs Note 9 Benchmark Comparison - The New King?

Apple is the church of scientology of the tech world I m offended by the self important manner in which Apple has created a technological apartheid mainly just by charging a lot more but also by distancing itself from ordinary PCs that s personal computers to the uninitiated PCs Apple wants you to know are for lowly poor and unimaginative people with boring jobs Apples on the other hand are for clever freewheeling creative types who like modern music and wear cargo shorts to work The whole thing makes me feel rather sick I don t want any part of a company that encourages the fetishising of its products and makes my kids feel inadequate because they don t own them I don t like the way that Apple appears to have a creepy quasi religious hold on its consumers one which fills them with a nagging sense of dissatisfaction if they don t have the very latest upgraded version of the must have gadget	UgxIDSbjJq39GFefn9R4AaABAg	2018-11-25T06:36:05.000Z	Comment	i_vlxL8-Y2E	iPhone XS Max vs Galaxy Note 9 SPEED Test - You May Be Surprised..

I wanted to address many of the comments Some people are complaining about the test not being fair because we ran the Note at full resolution but I m not going to gimp a phone when the galaxy phones are advertised at a specific performance spec Samsung doesn t get a free pass to advertise at one spec and get to test at a lower spec when it makes them look better The first thing I do when I get a Galaxy device is switch to standard normal full native resolution Reducing the resolution of Galaxy phones is literally putting them into power saver mode which is ridiculous since their specs are advertised as being superior to the iPhones I do mention in the video you can reduce resolution to improve battery life if you want to but you could also reduce brightness turn off wifi etc If you want to see a battery test where one of the phones is in power saver mode go watch someone else s video The funny thing is so many of internet bros are obsessed over PPI in all of my other videos They think the iPhone Xr is trash because it doesn t have PPI but the moment you run a battery test they want reduced resolution and lower PPI If Samsung wants to put in high resolution displays then they should ship their phones at the native resolution or they should ship them with a lower resolution display since all displays look crisper clearer at native res where pixels aren t shifting across one another causing fuzziness Maybe I should make a video about all of this Companies advertising higher resolution displays and then not even shipping the phones that way It s ridiculous Anyway hope you enjoyed the test See you in the next one	UgyWbi4Cu-f4NXTGvIB4AaABAg	2018-09-23T18:18:48.000Z	Comment	T4HdURgi_5M	Battery Test: iPhone Xs Max vs Note 9 vs S9+ vs iPhone Xs

The screen resolution is not all why the samsung lost The samsung has a ton of bloatware you need to disable that just comes from your carrier but the biggest battery drainer that Samsung has is wifi scanning in locations settings That thing is a huge load on the battery and I don t even think apple even has that technology But when you take that off lower the screen res to apple quality on the samsung and take off your bloatware then the samsung should last you about to hours I tested my note vs my friends note with all that enabled and he got around hours like in this video but I got around to hours on my note Disable those things to use your full battery potential	UgzLA4wGD67grETwhZ94AaABAg	2018-11-14T16:08:49.000Z	Comment	T4HdURgi_5M	Battery Test: iPhone Xs Max vs Note 9 vs S9+ vs iPhone Xs

Redrum you dumb moron if you lower the resosolution to be equivalent of the xs max then the note will absolutely murder it in battery life And if you want a much higher resolution you will get just slightly less battery life So they give you the full choice Really good resolution with incredible battery life or incredible resolution with really good battery life Note wins clearly on that regard Plus it comes with a faster in the box unlike apple And also the fast charger is significantly faster so as a total package when it comes to batteries note blows xs out of the water	UgyWbi4Cu-f4NXTGvIB4AaABAg.8lYX4Yr-hgy8m8zV-07m2K	2018-10-08T16:46:57.000Z	Reply	T4HdURgi_5M	Battery Test: iPhone Xs Max vs Note 9 vs S9+ vs iPhone Xs

sher s when you boot up the phone the first time the phone asks you what resolution you want to use and defaults in between p on the slider If you cannot figure out that the resolution is in display settings then you are retarded Also apple doesnt have a low power mode that lasts days Just because you got some fancy CPU doesnt mean this usage scenario paints the whole picture This guy showed everyone exactly what he wanted you to see he had used a very limited scenario with screen on time Honestly how many of you are going to stare at a phone screen for hours straight without charging You all need to get a life if hours more screen on time is going to rustle your jimmies	UgyWbi4Cu-f4NXTGvIB4AaABAg.8lYX4Yr-hgy8m6ZN1iC0E6	2018-10-07T18:11:27.000Z	Reply	T4HdURgi_5M	Battery Test: iPhone Xs Max vs Note 9 vs S9+ vs iPhone Xs

I think that what he says it s right if the device supports and mostly advertise that resolution that s the resolution the device should be running what I believe it s completely biased its that he uses only apps that obviously have bigger impact on the battery due to the higher resolution why not making phone calls using social media web browsing music play etc why not use apps where the screen resolution makes little or no difference	UgyWbi4Cu-f4NXTGvIB4AaABAg.8lYX4Yr-hgy8lfaZ5rRPDR	2018-09-26T21:31:51.000Z	Reply	T4HdURgi_5M	Battery Test: iPhone Xs Max vs Note 9 vs S9+ vs iPhone Xs

No doubt the iPhone has a great camera and in my opinion took better pictures when capturing the intense colors from the cars and street art However the Note took better pictures overall and did have significantly better low light pictures	UgytqESk_OIqvvJYeNF4AaABAg.8lYQacamJXP8la27LJSglM	2018-09-24T17:46:01.000Z	Reply	ZG2M1vFK7G8	iPhone XS Max vs Galaxy Note 9 - Best of the Premium Phones?

I see a lot of hypocrisy in these comments It was only months ago that the S had saturated pics and everybody hated it saying the colours were wrong and the IPX had better colour reproduction So with the Note Samsung went with a more natural tone and the new Iphones punched up the colours and now everybody is loving saturated pics judging by these comments FML	UgytqESk_OIqvvJYeNF4AaABAg.8lYQacamJXP8l_qzr2tuid	2018-09-24T16:00:00.000Z	Reply	ZG2M1vFK7G8	iPhone XS Max vs Galaxy Note 9 - Best of the Premium Phones?
