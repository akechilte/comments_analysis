HAPPY BIRTHDAY ROBERT CRICKEY ON	2018-12-01T20:38:12.000Z	Comment	hHXvi_oyMoo
I m really glad they brought easier animals for jimmy to handle Kinda rough with the baby otters but understandable when dealing with baby animals they can be frightened easily I would say try to bring in more domesticated aged wildlife animals from the zoo that are probably older and less energetic that way jimmy can hold and pet the animal without spazzing out and thinking the animals gonna bite him or mess him up	2018-12-01T19:27:17.000Z	Comment	hHXvi_oyMoo
I really hope Robert gets his own show to help educate younger audience about animals around the world much like his dad I think it would have made Steve incredibly proud to see his son carry on his work and love for the animal kingdom Good on you Robert keep up the good work mate	2018-12-01T19:14:57.000Z	Comment	hHXvi_oyMoo

someone sent me this a while ago not sure if this is real people l or just a joke This is brilliant We need more Prof s with a sense of humor like this one In her radio show Dr Laura Schlesinger is an observant Orthodox Jew who frequently quotes the bible She recently quoted selections from Leviticus to illustrate her point of view during a debate The following response is an open letter to Dr Laura penned by a professor at the University of Virginia which was posted on the Internet It s funny as well as informative Dear Dr Laura Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God s Law I have learned a great deal from your show and try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can When someone tries to defend their position on today s debate for example I simply remind them of the Leviticus scriptures End of debate I do need some advice from you however regarding some other elements of God s Laws and how to follow them Leviticus states that I may possess slaves both male and female provided they are purchased from neighboring nations A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans but not Canadians Can you clarify Why can t I own Canadians I would like to sell my daughter into slavery as sanctioned in Exodus In this day and age what do you think would be a fair price for her I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of Menstrual uncleanliness Lev The problem is how do I tell I have tried asking but most women take offense When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord Lev The problem is my neighbors They claim the odor is not pleasing to them Should I smite them I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath Exodus clearly states he should be put to death Am I morally obligated to kill him myself or should I ask the police to do it A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination Lev it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality Lev I don t understand Can you settle this Are there degrees of abomination Lev states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight I have to admit that I wear reading glasses Does my vision have to be or is there some wiggle room here Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed including the hair around their temples even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev How should they die I know from Lev that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean but may I still play football if I wear gloves My uncle has a farm He violates Lev by planting two different crops in the same field as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread cotton polyester blend He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them Lev Couldn t we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in laws Lev I know you have studied these things extensively and thus enjoy considerable expertise in such matters so I m confident you can help Thank you again for reminding us that God s word is eternal and unchanging Your adoring fan James M Kauffman Ed D Professor Emeritus Dept Of Curriculum Instruction and Special Education University of Virginia It would be a damn shame if we couldn t own a Canadian	2018-11-13T04:57:27.000Z	Comment	rpjAj8O5ga0

What is annoying is people thinking ABC was wrong and canceled it for political reasons Tim Allen has a movie Tv career literally because of Disney ABC ABC didn t own the rights to LMS which automatically makes the show cost more to begin with and contracts were up which meant pay raises were set to happen LMS only averaged around million viewers and was never a top rated show It is now at Fox and still only has about million viewers but they can do it cheaper over there It really is that simple folks	2018-11-25T08:33:30.000Z	Comment	uORZIZZ4wfY
