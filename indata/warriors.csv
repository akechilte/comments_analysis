Kinkade Koolaid What I mean is you will see Michael Jordan in accolade of showcasing Shoecasing modern day sports talent The Standards of which performance is rated is elite professional mentality following me Of all thr players sports wide including non basketball game of play all have template standards in which they fit and play in For a Legendary status one must accomodate the likeness and body of Micheal Jordan Mike Tyson or Michael Jackson Entertainment complex wide They make them out of padding stats around the chosen players already momentous skillset Michael Jordan was also taking HGH coke and was ruthless with gambling addictions He had another instict of the game that plays a couple steps ahead of willingness Also with his perfect frame and length he made some of what is nearly impossible for those who even posses the skill to actually do This goes for all the Mike s I just mentioned whom have stabdardized gladiator performance and entertainment idolatry Which is worshipped by the Goyim whom always have smocked at YHWH s perfect vessel The Hebrew in the game is lost but not the actual sheer athleticism which would be used to fight as warriors is not a game of put the ball into the hoop There is no way to slow this information down Rather giving it everywhere I enjoy spending my time I loved sports and played very well now I see a sales pitch inviting more of the lack lore to continue Question once these players make it to the professional standard who is managing their financial decisions None other than lawyers who work freely with the same company under contract So we have another imstitution by far overhead building into the actual culture of Hebrew contrubution and origin Which is very bad when I can see that this looks like fun but the demand that keeps it going is actually an engineering project of both social and cultural institution DON T LET THIS DISTRACT YOU FROM THE FACT THAT ISRAEL IS NOT AN OFFICIAL STATE	2018-12-03T07:17:09.000Z	Reply	zOMNLpXbkWw	Golden State Warriors vs Toronto Raptors Full Game Highlights NBA Season

Alan Pinho Yeah It is I dunno franchises have waived players before I suppose the Kings might find a reason to do that In which case Randolph would be a good addition to well anybody who is short a big man Unless there s a reason we don t know about for why they re sitting him It s not a good sign if he s not even suiting up I suppose the Kings don t have to tell us if he s hurt do they Meh The bottom line is Randolph is probably not the answer to the Dubs thin center problem But I say that knowing that Randolph s career has been pretty impressive and if he still has mileage left on those legs of his he s still an impact player at his position	2018-12-03T08:29:50.000Z	Reply	rr9O2lbf5rw	Centers the Golden State Warriors Should SIGN to Replace Damian Jones DeMarcus Cousins Returns

Alan Pinho I missed that the Kings were sitting Z Bo Huh Thanks for mentioning it But you know Randolph is on a million contract for two years this is year one Golden State doesn t have the cap room to absorb him their need is to get younger and cheaper not older and more expensive The only sure way to get him would be to trade valuable assets players picks But that makes no sense Randolph is years old He s not the future of any franchise at this point Giving up valuable assets for him would be a desperation move by a franchise that s determined to contend now even if it means sacrificing their future Golden State s front office knows not to make that mistake Those sorts of decisions can haunt a franchise for many years So might the Kings waive him and pay off his contract making him available for cheap I doubt it The Kings signed his contract just last summer They might prefer to develop their younger players but in the event of an injury he s a valuable backup If they make the playoffs they might even play him He ll be well rested and eager to fight for a ring I m sure the Kings will happily entertain trade offers but I don t see them eating his salary and handing him to the Dubs on a silver platter I think Zeller or either of the other two guys TBall mentioned remain better options for the Dubs If they decide to hire a center signing a serviceable big on the cheap is the way to go	2018-12-03T07:42:44.000Z	Reply	rr9O2lbf5rw	Centers the Golden State Warriors Should SIGN to Replace Damian Jones DeMarcus Cousins Returns

Coach Kerr already told us that Derickson has been called up from Santa Cruz to join the Dubs for the rest of this road trip Derickson is on a two way contract As it stands now they have Derickson available for limited games plus Looney and Bell and for small ball Green to play the That s not terrible except that Green is still out with a toe injury and every game Derickson plays is a game he can t play later That s thin TBall is right The Warriors should add a big to the roster I m leaning towards Zeller as a bench player behind Looney and Bell with Derickson going back to the G League But I don t know anything about Zeller s conditioning Can he hop right onto a bench and then into games It s been a while since he played at the NBA level	2018-12-03T02:13:13.000Z	Reply	rr9O2lbf5rw	Centers the Golden State Warriors Should SIGN to Replace Damian Jones DeMarcus Cousins Returns
