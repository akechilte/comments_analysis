Facts though why do they need all stars to win consistently Shit a lot of other teams are winning with only one They are definitely going to win another chip if everyone stays healthy but it seems they need a total and extreme advantage to win And people say Kerr is coach of the year when he wins with all stars but he cannot win with two or three Yes I understand chemistry is important but dam Also the assistant coach would have won it all last year or the year before if Kerr did not comeback from illness	2018-12-02T03:08:14.000Z	Comment	gWy4YQuGePs

idk why they say that KD hasn t led a team before As an OKC fan who has watched nearly every game over the last years he was neverrrrr second fiddle to Westbrook That was Durant s team and everyone knew he was the leader of that squad Russell was maybe the emotional leader but KD was the one who clutched up games and the fans expected him to be our consistent superstar Westbrook from was the guy who could go off at any moment and put up a surprising stat line especially once he started hitting those triple doubles consistently KD was the leader of the Thunder it only became Westbrook s team after KD left and he became MVP Facts only	2018-12-02T01:44:29.000Z	Comment	S563cwQCChc

First of all KD had the opportunity to lead a team because as a free agent he could have gone anywhere He decided not to and he said so when he chose GS He just wanted to play ball and he is At OKC it seemed that he had all the heroball he could stand This desire to have one hero player surrounded by pieces to beat everyone else is sad It seems that unless players do it that way they aren t as good as those who play like the team sport that it is KD chose GS and his game has evolved points in a loss is a good stat if you don t like winning Playing with a team scoring fewer points and winning sounds awful I guess Bottom line is that most people just want KD to go to LA or NYC and until KD does what others want him to do there ll be criticism of his choices	2018-12-02T01:23:37.000Z	Comment	S563cwQCChc

Undisputed started off good but it s pure shit now the only thing they talk objectively about is football and not even every time basketball is brought up no matter what it s about it always goes to Lebron and then to KD skip should be ashamed of his self they hardly talk sports any more it s just a petty media show with joy annoying don t say shit productive over talking yelling ass I never remember a mediator as oblivious as these mfs now her and the Rachel bitch and it s not that they women and I don t want to hear them speak it s just their not good I loved Jamele never had a problem with any others skip and Stephen a ruined everything by splitting neither one of their shows are informative at least when it cones to basketball their both petty and all they do is yell now I say this heartbroken because I grew up watching them to watch this blatant fall from grace is arduous and unsettling they need to do better especially since both their new cohost have very limited knowledge of basketball and to a lesser degree other sports and stop bringing up lebron when he s not even needed and for skip to not mention kawhi by name or at least give an full objective analysis of the game is cowardly man up and do your fucking job or your no better than YOUR opinion of kawhi I know other people have to see this train wreck	2018-12-01T05:23:32.000Z	Comment	5-QXZrtzeAM

Kawhi at What s this bald guy smoking He s a top for sure Best way player in the league Finals MVP In the all time defensive line up annually	2018-12-02T00:25:31.000Z	Comment	1wZPK4kRdAU
Before Kawhi was injured these guys said Kawhi was a top player And now he is in Canada he is top Now I understand why everybody hates the American media	2018-12-01T23:55:23.000Z	Comment	1wZPK4kRdAU
Everyone acting like bringing Curry Green Cousins back will net them more shots There s only ball and what s to say that Durant s wouldn t have just been spread amongst the other Look what s happening with the Celtics lol with the same amount of shots being taken and if any of them we re shooting less than from the field it would be to an even more disadvantage I m not saying Raptors GSW all I m saying is it s not as simple as plugging in those player s ppg and assuming you add it ontop of the game score	2018-12-01T22:59:18.000Z	Comment	1wZPK4kRdAU
What did Kawhi do to Golden State before he got Zaza d Similar things will happen if they meet in the finals	2018-12-01T22:04:24.000Z	Comment	1wZPK4kRdAU
Toronto won t be then same team come March either Kawhi is just coming into his own now and we are not seeing the perfect polished version of the Raptors we are going to get in the spring They are only going to get better One of the big takeaways should be how fast Kawhi has fused into the Raptors and the big impact Danny Green has had He is the steal of that deal with San Antonio And this little secret to the league that Pascal Siakam is a budding all star	2018-12-01T21:05:00.000Z	Comment	1wZPK4kRdAU
Jesus why would Kawhi not want to sign in Toronto He s on the team in basketball that is still young He s got freedom within the system and is in a market that loves the quiet lunch pail athlete Canada s got over million people and NBA team All of the big shoe companies are in Canada and he could trade up from that New Balance deal Jose Bautista invested heavily in Canadian businesses and it paid off If Kawhi went to the Clippers he d be lost in the shuffle even if they did win a championship It s not as if he has to live in Toronto just play and unload the dump trucks of money every couple of weeks It s so risky to change franchises There are so many issues that may arise that you d never know until you re there	2018-12-01T21:04:48.000Z	Comment	1wZPK4kRdAU
