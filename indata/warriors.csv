Lebron has been de throned Kevin Durant has established himself as the best player in the game Steph Curry is number Draymond and Curry didn t play This has done nothing for Toronto Also Everyone is forgetting about Boogie Cousins He will be in game shape by the post season I would like to see Toronto play the warriors with Boogie Cousins healthy Steph Curry and Draymond Can you imagine how good the Warriors will be at the end of the season As a Laker fan I m so upset with my favorite player of all time Magic Johnson for not getting Boogie Cousins We the lakers should try to get him in the off season I believe he is so under rated He just needs a coach that can push his limits If he stays in great shape skies the limit for Cousins You watch how he affects the Post season Give the Warriors the Championship right now Look out for Boston at the end of the season as well	UgzlEL9dmWohXcfzIIV4AaABAg	2018-12-03T17:12:47.000Z	Comment	28deP2POgfw	Charles Barkley & Shaq on Golden State Warriors LOSS TO Toronto Raptors 131-128 OT | Inside The NBA
