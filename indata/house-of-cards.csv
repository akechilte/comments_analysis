The last season really reeeeaaally sucks completely Claire is an awful annoying and antipathic character She destroys the first five seasons everything Francis the antiheroe we followed and enjoyed for years through the whole story fought to build she destroys it and shits on it and the story gave us a pink cursi end to Claire killing all her enemies like if it were that easy and with very high popularity Everyone are stupid even Doug except for her She wins and has a happy ending that s the message of season While I never expected a pink ending even for Francis something more complex No it was easy for the writers to make her win all her battles in a shitty way to use feminism	2018-11-26T17:17:07.000Z	Comment	2OdjW2WSfp8
This program actually worries me as for how people view males as it aligns with today s issues I discussed it with my family and concur on my thoughts This movement outside of this show and inside of this is no longer a feminist movement equality This is more of hatred towards men period I am all for female cabinets if they are awesome at what they do But this show gives me a warning not only from the entertainment but also political On behalf of good natured men we apologize for the past but we did not cause these things as things have progressed forward As a person that wants nothing but equality this is gearing me towards being more prejudiced towards women on a defensive level which I never thought to encounter I doubt this message will do anything but it is something to take note	2018-11-26T01:10:21.000Z	Comment	2OdjW2WSfp8

This last season was awful and so predictable and transparent The virtue signaling was over the top whether it was the all female cabinet or the fact that all of the season s male main characters died Doug Bill Shephard Tom Hammershmidt and magically Claire Annette and Janine all survive It seemed like the agenda was to virtue signal and the agenda was to have an interesting season Well they successfully accomplished by sacrificing	2018-11-28T11:11:04.000Z	Comment	YFmaubKJOaY

Well here s how I see it The thing is house of cards is certainly not for everybody If you are looking for a story like soap opera with sometimes touches of comedy romance and politics as shown in Shonda Rhimes Scandal this show is definitely not it However if by any chance you are tempted by very dark themes overcoming the betrayal of your circle by using machinations the quest for power through sharp strategies other topics like the power of influence loyalty leadership critical decision making guilt getting dirty hands and a lot of mind games if you like those then you can definitely enjoy what certainly is one of the very best shows in my opinion Hope this helped	2018-11-21T22:32:08.000Z	Reply	ULwUzF1q5w4

I m not even going to argue with you on this one Fuck house of cards fuck kevin spacey who gives a fuck anymore but ok let s see how long it takes for you to give me a headache Yep dude in West Wing was not morally righteous compared to Underwood Underwood had the same aspirations but different motivations and they shared similar levels of tolerance for sacrifice for the greater good of their cause Bartlet had a fine share of controversies under a different light The truth you refuse to acknowledge is the political lean between the broadcasting networks and the climate within our country within the timeframe that each show aired Again and again and again you fail to acknowledge real sociology but rather framing marketing ploys in a way that suits your narrative supported by a select set of archaic philosophers who can be attributed to hundreds if not thousands of works of art and literature leaning to the left on political sociological and philosophical spectrums You sir are trash You need some independent journalists with objective perspectives If you can manage that I think you have a bright future If not I hope you rot and find some other profession to feed yourself with But I will not condone legislature that prevents you from making the false claims you make and illegalize the bullshit you spew from you mouth to the masses because I believe our greatest contribution to the world has been and will always be free mother fuckin speech biatch	2018-10-16T06:09:58.000Z	Comment	2de3LhPxpZU

Wow I thought this was the ending season I watched all episodes and thought the were still RELEASING EPISODES BECAUSE THE OTHER SEASONS ALL HAD episode I was excited to see how this would end and didn t even know that Doug dying WAS the end until I saw this Honestly sad This is proof of how story telling is dying People always stretch out their story as long as they can with the exception of some shows like Breaking Bad I was hoping for an ending scene with Claire dead in the White House with some great cinematic scene It s also sad because season was actually pretty good a lot better then I was expecting since Kevin frank underwood wouldn t be in it If anything this season passed other seasons in the story telling ability I loved seeing Doug so much and he turned into my favorite character This season still would be good if it had a proper ending seasons for this show also did seem appropriate not too stretched out Really wish they gave us a better ending Just my opinion	2018-11-29T21:00:30.000Z	Comment	XKvOcQV6E5c

After season I could not stomach another there s just to much stupidity behind that cloak and dagger I mean Trump makes a typo in the middle of the night and alarm bells go off at media outlets country wide yet here s Frank and Claire committing multiple homicides with absolutely no repercussions Prison Break had the most rock stupid political setup as the axis on which the events and characters oscillated yet even that show respected the viewer enough to acknowledge that there s only so much collateral damage you can sweep under the rug before suspicions are raised Frank and Claire s entire journey is nothing but a slide into the abyss where the only thing that is quantifiable is how many people they drag down with them No revelation s No catharsis No justice It s a series that s simply too terrified to shake the tree petrified as to what it could mean for its star attraction s	2018-11-29T03:34:59.000Z	Comment	_1x2oQTjPts

I feel sorry for all those who were bothered by Spacey That being said he did a phenomenal job with this show It s interesting to see how tge show is about people not being good or bad but instead a mixture The same goes in real life with Kevin He made wrong choices in a time when such things were considered pretty much normal even nowadays a president can grab them by the And yet even though he behaved inappropriately he s a phenomenal talent and I would still like to see him in the movies	2018-11-28T23:19:33.000Z	Comment	7kpwFIyTUqU

But that s the whole point Underwood in his universe is neither likable nor charming Everyone around him mostly hates him and know how dangerous he is Even the people in HoC Universe don t like Underwood Following his rise to power and while being interviewed it is said that Underwood s popularity is extremely low Besides the UK version is not known enough me myself I discovered that a British version exists only a year ago that s why Underwood is more appealing to audiences around the world	2018-10-09T18:18:46.000Z	Reply	5VB_JMvcVfs
Emperor Palpatine Perhaps it differs in our languages but in my it often means highly likable charming convincing and don t get me wrong bot charachters are but Underwood is more likable in reasons i stated before more charming aswell but in convincing i need to give it to Urquarth because he does it more unviolently Yes we cannot value it objectivly but trust me more people outside UK find Underwood more apealing	2018-10-09T18:04:37.000Z	Reply	5VB_JMvcVfs
Your whole argument can be brought down by just a few words I am Greek And perhaps you do not seem to know what charisma actually is What you describe in Frank Underwood s character is mostly passion rather than charisma While passion is just part of charisma it s not the whole thing Francis Urquhart is by far more charismatic than Underwood but perhaps less passionate but this is the classic calm and aristocratic British way which to me and many other people is the grandeur of his charm Anyway the matter is a bit subjective but the use of proper adjectives is not	2018-10-09T17:54:25.000Z	Reply	5VB_JMvcVfs
Emperor Palpatine Look at the first season of American HoC and look at the first season of british the difference is obvious To non british viewers Urquarth is dull boring and often now sorry for this i will probably misspell non enthusiastic while on the other hand Underwood is charming full of action and he is quite trustworthy But i believe also that Spacey brought the best and he is the main reason for me why is Underwood so charismatic And what i also enjoyed more in American version is Underwoods dynamic with other charachters and how sometimes he trough sheer threat gets what he wants	2018-10-09T17:43:34.000Z	Reply	5VB_JMvcVfs
Quite the opposite It is Francis Urquhart who has the charisma look how aristocratic charming trusting and convincing he is while in reality he is the Devil himself Frank Underwood is cold untrustworthy by most of those they surround him and extremely unpopular in his universe Besides after watching the fifth season his character is all but destroyed	2018-09-25T01:20:13.000Z	Reply	5VB_JMvcVfs

Amirah Kukan no I don t think he s been charged yet The thing is with cases like that is that they happened so long ago there s very little physical evidence that still exists that can be used in court But so many people came forward and confirmed it and Spacey didn t exactly help himself either by pretty much admitting it and then coming out as a way to kind of deflect any responsibility from it I think it just really riled people up and then all the allegations came out and made it pretty impossible to defend himself in the public eye	2018-11-09T18:45:37.000Z	Reply	WlqZZpYqFqE

Awful absolutely awful season They needed a new actor with the same level of charisma as Spacey and we got monotone Diane Lane and dull Greg Kinnear Uninspired plots lame story arcs for the season Michael Kelly tried to carry the season but just couldn t do it alone The writing was rushed and just awful They should have taken a longer hiatus and done it well instead of the crap they filmed	2018-11-24T01:22:59.000Z	Comment	sjzzpS15JIk

I think you were way too nice to this season in your review They introduced like different plot lines and multiple new characters and they went NOWHERE Most of the episodes were pointless in the long run Most of the episodes had no meaning That s terrible writing The finale is one of the worst finales ever It would have been somewhat tolerable if they had like more episodes after it to tie up ANY of the plot lines introduced in this season besides the mystery of Frank s death but they didn t They also tried to introduce a pro feminism anti feminism message that tried to have its cake and eat it too when they should have just kept the entire issue out of the show since that too went nowhere Terrible season that has tarnished the show IMO Terrible terrible terrible	2018-11-20T06:11:46.000Z	Comment	sjzzpS15JIk
This was horrible and it should have ended last year However the only good thing I can say about the final episode which I haven t heard a reviewer has said about the show is the final line Claire says She says the same line about pain that Frank said in the first few minutes of the first episode of the show When he is dealing with the dog that got hit by the car and breaking the fourth wall to us he then snaps its neck and you hear him say there no more pain Maybe she meant it also for us after that snooze of a season	2018-11-20T00:47:41.000Z	Comment	sjzzpS15JIk

I can t believe that we wasted years watching this once great show Season was okay but it wasn t wrapped up very well Did Frank deserve death yes he was a dirty bastard that I loved and hated at the same time But killing him off screen at the hands of his most loyal subject was disappointing We all know of his scandal but wow Claire is great but she s much more enjoyable while riding shotgun with Frank Let s be honest without Frank Claire would had NEVER had a chance at becoming president RIP President Underwood Uggggh how could they leave us this way like Donna Summer	2018-11-10T09:36:37.000Z	Comment	sjzzpS15JIk

crazy deranged feminists wrote this awful mess for season They took a decent actress from Forest Gump and resurrected a feminist uninteresting sociopath and thought they could make the main character as interesting as Frank Underwood Robin your talent is still dead and a distant memory in a small Alabama town called Greenbow Ironic that a white male was responsible for this shows success too Season suffered from a lethal PC injection of SJW feminism and died a slow boring painful death in episodes And maybe that was the entire idea by the writers	2018-11-30T16:37:21.000Z	Comment	TWNukM92y1o
A total waste of Wright s talent Squandered on an anti white male feminist social justice warrior s world elevated to the presidency This story line reads more like a SJW s Utopian world Wright does her best even when speaking to us the audience scenes but I found little interest in what she was saying and how anticlimactic in the way she said it Spacey made you hate him with his sense of humor Robin has none of this None of the cast were very inspiring or interesting to watch Frank Underwood made these people interesting Without him they became soap opera stand ins with desperate acting looking for a plot Nut grabber or not Kevin s acting skills made this show none of the other cast came close	2018-11-30T16:08:56.000Z	Comment	TWNukM92y1o
Ive struggled through episode and just not sure I can keep going House of Cards by its title has always been interesting because the plot ran on Francis precise and deliberate planning but there is always tension because one error or misjudgment could bring Underwood down In this season the house of cards falls off screen Francis who was a big but fragile man aka a house of cards Claire isn t any of that Claire is unflinching indestructible super woman with a touch of Terminator and no emotion I just dont get the same house of cards feeling watching Claire act like this	2018-11-30T12:49:17.000Z	Comment	TWNukM92y1o

what was the point of even making that video as if NOBODY said that oh there is no point watching the show now spacey is gone before No really Everybody has already said that It s safe to assume people who did decide to watch the show knew that in season there would be no Frank and they were curious to see how Claire can do it The problem is not the character of Claire She COULD have carried the show We ve seen her growth through the seasons we saw that she used to be milder and had principles but grew stronger and more ruthless she had a great character ark It would have been interesting how she would handle same kinds of problems How she would manoeuvre and manipulate her way in the big politics The problem with the show is the ridiculous ridicuolous ridiculous in its ridiculousness story First of all the story is all over the place And secondly it s just silly It was such a tonal change I mean previous seasons had that from time to time But now I actually kinda enjoyed this season because it was so bad it s good kinda thing	2018-11-29T06:51:53.000Z	Comment	TWNukM92y1o

It s kinda prophetic and poetic albeit unintentionally that Kevin Spacey suffered precisely the downfall that a major character in season of house of cards an enemy of Underwood s suffered The problem wasn t guilty until proven innocent regarding whatever Spacey did or didn t do in and and etc People involved in the show itself claimed that he made them feel unsafe and made it a toxic environment Once that came out of course they had to kick him out Too bad I would have loved to see his ultimate downfall onscreen	2018-11-03T04:50:21.000Z	Comment	Cy_Kws0wdX4

Even though it s been revealed that the actor Kevin Spacey was a scumbag criminal of the worst kind I still think the show runners for the sake of the story should have written out Frank Underwood We watch this show for the two halfs of this robotic team They should have just re casted the role of Frank Underwood If the actors convinces us of the illusion they are selling then they did their job rightfully I never feel that it s always meant for just one person	2018-08-17T16:53:20.000Z	Comment	dNAFTJ_Blg8

The cinematography is amazing Like something out of a Christopher Nolan film The writing is Shakespearean fast and witty and darkly poetic The acting is flawless as if the characters are completely unaware of a camera in the room save for the fact that Kevin Spacey breaks the fourth wall to give us insight into his menacing thoughts The plot is about a politician who will stop at nothing to climb the political ladder and get to the top It s a madman trying to take over the world concept Frank Underwood Kevin Spacey and his wife are ruthless Darwinists who are master manipulators and won t hesitate to orchestrate homicide just to become President and First Lady of the U S	2015-07-04T08:00:06.000Z	Comment	SseGZNMujXs

Netflix should really use this video as promo material because it shows how Claire was starting to take over and become the main player especially in the second half of the video and it also shows Franks exit and that would show people it isn t past the norm not to have Spacey in it because it was always heading this way	2018-08-12T22:18:43.000Z	Comment	g4vHbJ73Ao0

Say what you want about his orientations but Kevin Spacey is one of the greatest actors alive Killing off a character like that for some allegations decades ago only proves how obsessed we are with being politically correct Ironic given the show s theme Also f you Netflix	2018-10-07T19:18:21.000Z	Comment	eUQqeabxnNU

Wow this was way worse than I thought it would be Nothing good about it really just beyond silly with insane amount of over the top feminism Which that is in just about everything now but maybe this season was the crowning jewel for the I woman I perfect crowd Extremely boring and waste of time watching it Without Kevin Spacey the show collapsed completely but it hadn t been very good in the last few years But was way better than the mess they put up this year Netflix should be embarrassed but I m sure they are not It was after all just about women mostly even though they tried to hide some of it behind her being such a terrible person	2018-11-11T03:58:22.000Z	Comment	yCIopZbsVK4
