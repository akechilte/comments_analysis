The last season really reeeeaaally sucks completely Claire is an awful annoying and antipathic character She destroys the first five seasons everything Francis the antiheroe we followed and enjoyed for years through the whole story fought to build she destroys it and shits on it and the story gave us a pink cursi end to Claire killing all her enemies like if it were that easy and with very high popularity Everyone are stupid even Doug except for her She wins and has a happy ending that s the message of season While I never expected a pink ending even for Francis something more complex No it was easy for the writers to make her win all her battles in a shitty way to use feminism	2018-11-26T17:17:07.000Z	Comment	2OdjW2WSfp8	House of Cards: Season 6 | Official Trailer [HD] | Netflix
This program actually worries me as for how people view males as it aligns with today s issues I discussed it with my family and concur on my thoughts This movement outside of this show and inside of this is no longer a feminist movement equality This is more of hatred towards men period I am all for female cabinets if they are awesome at what they do But this show gives me a warning not only from the entertainment but also political On behalf of good natured men we apologize for the past but we did not cause these things as things have progressed forward As a person that wants nothing but equality this is gearing me towards being more prejudiced towards women on a defensive level which I never thought to encounter I doubt this message will do anything but it is something to take note	2018-11-26T01:10:21.000Z	Comment	2OdjW2WSfp8	House of Cards: Season 6 | Official Trailer [HD] | Netflix

Miss Kevin Spacey too But new Madam President is simply fantastic Greg Kinner and Diane Lane especially a bit overplayed but Robin was great Maybe entire plot was not so interesting but somehow Robin Wright took it to the next level especially loved that scene in episode when she explains the snapshot taken simply brilliant job	2018-11-24T11:22:38.000Z	Comment	2OdjW2WSfp8	House of Cards: Season 6 | Official Trailer [HD] | Netflix

This last season was awful and so predictable and transparent The virtue signaling was over the top whether it was the all female cabinet or the fact that all of the season s male main characters died Doug Bill Shephard Tom Hammershmidt and magically Claire Annette and Janine all survive It seemed like the agenda was to virtue signal and the agenda was to have an interesting season Well they successfully accomplished by sacrificing	2018-11-28T11:11:04.000Z	Comment	YFmaubKJOaY	House of Cards Ending Explained: Season 6

Well here s how I see it The thing is house of cards is certainly not for everybody If you are looking for a story like soap opera with sometimes touches of comedy romance and politics as shown in Shonda Rhimes Scandal this show is definitely not it However if by any chance you are tempted by very dark themes overcoming the betrayal of your circle by using machinations the quest for power through sharp strategies other topics like the power of influence loyalty leadership critical decision making guilt getting dirty hands and a lot of mind games if you like those then you can definitely enjoy what certainly is one of the very best shows in my opinion Hope this helped	2018-11-21T22:32:08.000Z	Reply	ULwUzF1q5w4	House of Cards Official Trailer HD Netflix

I m not even going to argue with you on this one Fuck house of cards fuck kevin spacey who gives a fuck anymore but ok let s see how long it takes for you to give me a headache Yep dude in West Wing was not morally righteous compared to Underwood Underwood had the same aspirations but different motivations and they shared similar levels of tolerance for sacrifice for the greater good of their cause Bartlet had a fine share of controversies under a different light The truth you refuse to acknowledge is the political lean between the broadcasting networks and the climate within our country within the timeframe that each show aired Again and again and again you fail to acknowledge real sociology but rather framing marketing ploys in a way that suits your narrative supported by a select set of archaic philosophers who can be attributed to hundreds if not thousands of works of art and literature leaning to the left on political sociological and philosophical spectrums You sir are trash You need some independent journalists with objective perspectives If you can manage that I think you have a bright future If not I hope you rot and find some other profession to feed yourself with But I will not condone legislature that prevents you from making the false claims you make and illegalize the bullshit you spew from you mouth to the masses because I believe our greatest contribution to the world has been and will always be free mother fuckin speech biatch	2018-10-16T06:09:58.000Z	Comment	2de3LhPxpZU	The Philosophy of House of Cards – Wisecrack Edition

Maaan at the end of S I was really looking forward to Claire showing em how it s done She had been PERFECT throughout The Entire Show always able to keep her cool and stay classy independent and empowering at the same time It was painful to watch her put up with his temper tantrums acting like a spoiled baby in S He was turning into a Stalin like paranoid o and Needed to GOOOO She was there ready to replace him and America would be saved Alas S was a complete let down an EMBARRASSMENT and exercise in misogyny and gynophobia Despite the many opportunities to take the show TO THE NEXT LEVEL the writers instead made it into a soap opera dragging us back decades in how we see women Has Disney not vilified powerful women enough I said powerful not seductive If she is not in the kitchen she must be the devil spawn Well of course everyone hates her she is Frank Underwood s wife So prove the world wrong Claire commands respect like no one else on the show Her husband commanded fear and mostly disgust towards the end but she is a mystery a beacon of patience and persistence She was a blank slate and this is what they did with her character A more evil conniving version of FU Then pardon me why all the innuendos about how she won t be like him For tragedy Oh look she thought she could be better but power ruins all Not necessarily There have been some pretty great rulers in history and I was really hoping to see a great ruler at the end of the show replacing tired old Frankey solely devoted to staying in power We see this shit on the news enough Gimme HOPE P S This is obviously Tom s baby she s carrying Does this not matter at all Is it implied Or am I Really supposed to believe it s Frank s Because I can t do that just can t I also hate that they made her preggos P P S Definitely never wanna see Mark shirtless again Definitely	2018-12-03T04:03:11.000Z	Comment	_1x2oQTjPts	House of Cards | Season 6 Review

I really like these people but with all due respect this final season was really disappointing in many ways I m not sure if it was absolutely necessary to get rid of Kevin Spacey at all Many others have continued to work in spite of worse accusations and they should have simply forged ahead with Spacey As it turned out this season was nowhere near as good as previous seasons and if we re being honest it s mostly because of the loss of Kevin Spacey s character	2018-11-06T04:22:12.000Z	Comment	tde8pD6197I	"Robin Wright on ""House of Cards"" Season 6 Without Kevin Spacey | E!

Black Hawk I mean the story was about frank underwood he was the main character Of course we all knew he would be offed but we assumed that would be the end of series Sure Kevin spacey is a terrible person but that doesn t negate the fact that he was an amazing actor who was the life of the series	2018-11-07T03:32:54.000Z	Reply	tde8pD6197I	Robin Wright on House of Cards Season Without Kevin Spacey E Red Carpet Award Shows

Wow I thought this was the ending season I watched all episodes and thought the were still RELEASING EPISODES BECAUSE THE OTHER SEASONS ALL HAD episode I was excited to see how this would end and didn t even know that Doug dying WAS the end until I saw this Honestly sad This is proof of how story telling is dying People always stretch out their story as long as they can with the exception of some shows like Breaking Bad I was hoping for an ending scene with Claire dead in the White House with some great cinematic scene It s also sad because season was actually pretty good a lot better then I was expecting since Kevin frank underwood wouldn t be in it If anything this season passed other seasons in the story telling ability I loved seeing Doug so much and he turned into my favorite character This season still would be good if it had a proper ending seasons for this show also did seem appropriate not too stretched out Really wish they gave us a better ending Just my opinion	2018-11-29T21:00:30.000Z	Comment	XKvOcQV6E5c	RECAP!!! - House of Cards: Season 6

I watched the UK original version and I have to say given the absence of Frank in the final season of the Netflix rendition and the crash ending both are inferior to the original Fans of this show should seek out the original if they are disappointed in the Netflix ending It s no longer available on Netflix but I m sure its out there In my opinion its just better overall	2018-11-09T18:52:50.000Z	Comment	WlqZZpYqFqE	House Of Cards: Original Ending Explained
deffinition yes I remember hearing about it but not actually reading about it She had a point He can be judged and sentenced by the public and rightly so if he behaved that way One thing you can t take away is his body of work I can t be a hypocrite and say well he was always shit really No he wasn t There s sort of an injustice about the way his work has been I donk know exiled Ex communicated from the creative world Reminds me of the mob And rome How merciless in this case he s all but guilty But I think of others who aren t Sends a chill down me It really does	2018-11-10T15:01:59.000Z	Reply	WlqZZpYqFqE	House Of Cards Original Ending Explained

Amirah Kukan no I don t think he s been charged yet The thing is with cases like that is that they happened so long ago there s very little physical evidence that still exists that can be used in court But so many people came forward and confirmed it and Spacey didn t exactly help himself either by pretty much admitting it and then coming out as a way to kind of deflect any responsibility from it I think it just really riled people up and then all the allegations came out and made it pretty impossible to defend himself in the public eye	2018-11-09T18:45:37.000Z	Reply	WlqZZpYqFqE	House Of Cards Original Ending Explained
That s interesting What I find I can t think of the right words Spacey hadn t actually been charged Has he I don t think he had and if he hasn t they re allegations He said he said sort of thing Now I m not defending him but everyone has a right to defend themselves in court He didn t get that He was pronounced guilty by the media and as a result lost everything That s not right It just isn t Something stinks about the whole thing I dont condone his alleged behaviour But why hasn t he been charged Do you know	2018-11-09T18:12:19.000Z	Reply	WlqZZpYqFqE	House Of Cards Original Ending Explained
It s a real Kobayashi Maru By keeping him Kevin Spacey would essentially get a pass for his real life actions it s about time Hollywood actors started getting what they deserve for the crap they do But without him the final season feels so disconnected from the rest of the show and it s not as good without him in it	2018-11-29T04:27:03.000Z	Reply	WlqZZpYqFqE	House Of Cards Original Ending Explained

crazy deranged feminists wrote this awful mess for season They took a decent actress from Forest Gump and resurrected a feminist uninteresting sociopath and thought they could make the main character as interesting as Frank Underwood Robin your talent is still dead and a distant memory in a small Alabama town called Greenbow Ironic that a white male was responsible for this shows success too Season suffered from a lethal PC injection of SJW feminism and died a slow boring painful death in episodes And maybe that was the entire idea by the writers	2018-11-30T16:37:21.000Z	Comment	TWNukM92y1o	House of Cards Season 6 RANT not REVIEW

Ive struggled through episode and just not sure I can keep going House of Cards by its title has always been interesting because the plot ran on Francis precise and deliberate planning but there is always tension because one error or misjudgment could bring Underwood down In this season the house of cards falls off screen Francis who was a big but fragile man aka a house of cards Claire isn t any of that Claire is unflinching indestructible super woman with a touch of Terminator and no emotion I just dont get the same house of cards feeling watching Claire act like this	2018-11-30T12:49:17.000Z	Comment	TWNukM92y1o	House of Cards Season 6 RANT not REVIEW

what was the point of even making that video as if NOBODY said that oh there is no point watching the show now spacey is gone before No really Everybody has already said that It s safe to assume people who did decide to watch the show knew that in season there would be no Frank and they were curious to see how Claire can do it The problem is not the character of Claire She COULD have carried the show We ve seen her growth through the seasons we saw that she used to be milder and had principles but grew stronger and more ruthless she had a great character ark It would have been interesting how she would handle same kinds of problems How she would manoeuvre and manipulate her way in the big politics The problem with the show is the ridiculous ridicuolous ridiculous in its ridiculousness story First of all the story is all over the place And secondly it s just silly It was such a tonal change I mean previous seasons had that from time to time But now I actually kinda enjoyed this season because it was so bad it s good kinda thing	2018-11-29T06:51:53.000Z	Comment	TWNukM92y1o	House of Cards Season 6 RANT not REVIEW

The books by Michael Dobbs is even better all of the background is explained and the reader is completely informed of the thoughts and plans from FU Also unlike the film FU decides to bring down the PM on his own he doesn t tell his wife until he s already started Dobbs also successfully masters the political climate in not only the party and the opposition but in the press The novel is read as the reader can fully see and understand the interconnected web of politics the press and power It s one of if not the best political novel ever written	2018-07-15T08:03:17.000Z	Comment	5VB_JMvcVfs	House of cards S01E01

But that s the whole point Underwood in his universe is neither likable nor charming Everyone around him mostly hates him and know how dangerous he is Even the people in HoC Universe don t like Underwood Following his rise to power and while being interviewed it is said that Underwood s popularity is extremely low Besides the UK version is not known enough me myself I discovered that a British version exists only a year ago that s why Underwood is more appealing to audiences around the world	2018-10-09T18:18:46.000Z	Reply	5VB_JMvcVfs	House of cards S E
Emperor Palpatine Perhaps it differs in our languages but in my it often means highly likable charming convincing and don t get me wrong bot charachters are but Underwood is more likable in reasons i stated before more charming aswell but in convincing i need to give it to Urquarth because he does it more unviolently Yes we cannot value it objectivly but trust me more people outside UK find Underwood more apealing	2018-10-09T18:04:37.000Z	Reply	5VB_JMvcVfs	House of cards S E
Your whole argument can be brought down by just a few words I am Greek And perhaps you do not seem to know what charisma actually is What you describe in Frank Underwood s character is mostly passion rather than charisma While passion is just part of charisma it s not the whole thing Francis Urquhart is by far more charismatic than Underwood but perhaps less passionate but this is the classic calm and aristocratic British way which to me and many other people is the grandeur of his charm Anyway the matter is a bit subjective but the use of proper adjectives is not	2018-10-09T17:54:25.000Z	Reply	5VB_JMvcVfs	House of cards S E
Emperor Palpatine Look at the first season of American HoC and look at the first season of british the difference is obvious To non british viewers Urquarth is dull boring and often now sorry for this i will probably misspell non enthusiastic while on the other hand Underwood is charming full of action and he is quite trustworthy But i believe also that Spacey brought the best and he is the main reason for me why is Underwood so charismatic And what i also enjoyed more in American version is Underwoods dynamic with other charachters and how sometimes he trough sheer threat gets what he wants	2018-10-09T17:43:34.000Z	Reply	5VB_JMvcVfs	House of cards S E
Quite the opposite It is Francis Urquhart who has the charisma look how aristocratic charming trusting and convincing he is while in reality he is the Devil himself Frank Underwood is cold untrustworthy by most of those they surround him and extremely unpopular in his universe Besides after watching the fifth season his character is all but destroyed	2018-09-25T01:20:13.000Z	Reply	5VB_JMvcVfs	House of cards S E

It s kinda prophetic and poetic albeit unintentionally that Kevin Spacey suffered precisely the downfall that a major character in season of house of cards an enemy of Underwood s suffered The problem wasn t guilty until proven innocent regarding whatever Spacey did or didn t do in and and etc People involved in the show itself claimed that he made them feel unsafe and made it a toxic environment Once that came out of course they had to kick him out Too bad I would have loved to see his ultimate downfall onscreen	2018-11-03T04:50:21.000Z	Comment	Cy_Kws0wdX4	"HOUSE OF CARDS Season 6 ""Death of Frank Underwood"" Trailer (NEW 2018) Netflix Series HD"

The cinematography is amazing Like something out of a Christopher Nolan film The writing is Shakespearean fast and witty and darkly poetic The acting is flawless as if the characters are completely unaware of a camera in the room save for the fact that Kevin Spacey breaks the fourth wall to give us insight into his menacing thoughts The plot is about a politician who will stop at nothing to climb the political ladder and get to the top It s a madman trying to take over the world concept Frank Underwood Kevin Spacey and his wife are ruthless Darwinists who are master manipulators and won t hesitate to orchestrate homicide just to become President and First Lady of the U S	2015-07-04T08:00:06.000Z	Comment	SseGZNMujXs	HOUSE OF CARDS | TRAILER | Netflix Original Series | HD

I found the scene where Frank pushed the chair that Garett used to sit in amusing af He forcefully pushed the chair like how he forced Garett out of his own seat as the freaking president How firm and calculated that push of that chair and how they portrayed that Frank Underwood is now in control with the last scene of him knocking at the table Fucking phenomenal Goosebumps all over	2018-07-06T02:24:08.000Z	Comment	i439idYNisk	House of Cards season 2 - President Frank Underwood
