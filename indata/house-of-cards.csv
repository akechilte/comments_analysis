The last season really reeeeaaally sucks completely Claire is an awful annoying and antipathic character She destroys the first five seasons everything Francis the antiheroe we followed and enjoyed for years through the whole story fought to build she destroys it and shits on it and the story gave us a pink cursi end to Claire killing all her enemies like if it were that easy and with very high popularity Everyone are stupid even Doug except for her She wins and has a happy ending that s the message of season While I never expected a pink ending even for Francis something more complex No it was easy for the writers to make her win all her battles in a shitty way to use feminism	Ugx1G4T1HFKMWaKSgnx4AaABAg	2018-11-26T17:17:07.000Z	Comment	2OdjW2WSfp8	House of Cards: Season 6 | Official Trailer [HD] | Netflix
This program actually worries me as for how people view males as it aligns with today s issues I discussed it with my family and concur on my thoughts This movement outside of this show and inside of this is no longer a feminist movement equality This is more of hatred towards men period I am all for female cabinets if they are awesome at what they do But this show gives me a warning not only from the entertainment but also political On behalf of good natured men we apologize for the past but we did not cause these things as things have progressed forward As a person that wants nothing but equality this is gearing me towards being more prejudiced towards women on a defensive level which I never thought to encounter I doubt this message will do anything but it is something to take note	UgwKVjRRM-3NNAZZ7nV4AaABAg	2018-11-26T01:10:21.000Z	Comment	2OdjW2WSfp8	House of Cards: Season 6 | Official Trailer [HD] | Netflix

This last season was awful and so predictable and transparent The virtue signaling was over the top whether it was the all female cabinet or the fact that all of the season s male main characters died Doug Bill Shephard Tom Hammershmidt and magically Claire Annette and Janine all survive It seemed like the agenda was to virtue signal and the agenda was to have an interesting season Well they successfully accomplished by sacrificing	UgxVM81l19ZiEeNMRnl4AaABAg	2018-11-28T11:11:04.000Z	Comment	YFmaubKJOaY	House of Cards Ending Explained: Season 6

Well here s how I see it The thing is house of cards is certainly not for everybody If you are looking for a story like soap opera with sometimes touches of comedy romance and politics as shown in Shonda Rhimes Scandal this show is definitely not it However if by any chance you are tempted by very dark themes overcoming the betrayal of your circle by using machinations the quest for power through sharp strategies other topics like the power of influence loyalty leadership critical decision making guilt getting dirty hands and a lot of mind games if you like those then you can definitely enjoy what certainly is one of the very best shows in my opinion Hope this helped	UgwreGA3XR3pwgHacPF4AaABAg.8nqklpmY44W8nvtyhpAoXn	2018-11-21T22:32:08.000Z	Reply	ULwUzF1q5w4	House of Cards | Official Trailer [HD] | Netflix

I m not even going to argue with you on this one Fuck house of cards fuck kevin spacey who gives a fuck anymore but ok let s see how long it takes for you to give me a headache Yep dude in West Wing was not morally righteous compared to Underwood Underwood had the same aspirations but different motivations and they shared similar levels of tolerance for sacrifice for the greater good of their cause Bartlet had a fine share of controversies under a different light The truth you refuse to acknowledge is the political lean between the broadcasting networks and the climate within our country within the timeframe that each show aired Again and again and again you fail to acknowledge real sociology but rather framing marketing ploys in a way that suits your narrative supported by a select set of archaic philosophers who can be attributed to hundreds if not thousands of works of art and literature leaning to the left on political sociological and philosophical spectrums You sir are trash You need some independent journalists with objective perspectives If you can manage that I think you have a bright future If not I hope you rot and find some other profession to feed yourself with But I will not condone legislature that prevents you from making the false claims you make and illegalize the bullshit you spew from you mouth to the masses because I believe our greatest contribution to the world has been and will always be free mother fuckin speech biatch	UgybN1Aec46nmTPirJZ4AaABAg	2018-10-16T06:09:58.000Z	Comment	2de3LhPxpZU	The Philosophy of House of Cards – Wisecrack Edition

I stopped watching season when Claire let the bird go and started speaking like Kevin House of cards have earlier brought me inspiration but turned out the opposide real quick When are they going to ruin all the other shows out there because of sexual acts done while drunk If it happens they would have to strip down the whole movie and music industry Now back to watching season one last time before burying the show with a last season of crap on top of it	UgzWhEupIupbDB675-t4AaABAg	2018-11-09T00:18:03.000Z	Comment	tde8pD6197I	"Robin Wright on ""House of Cards"" Season 6 Without Kevin Spacey | E!

I really like these people but with all due respect this final season was really disappointing in many ways I m not sure if it was absolutely necessary to get rid of Kevin Spacey at all Many others have continued to work in spite of worse accusations and they should have simply forged ahead with Spacey As it turned out this season was nowhere near as good as previous seasons and if we re being honest it s mostly because of the loss of Kevin Spacey s character	UgyDvav3TngB7UPc1914AaABAg	2018-11-06T04:22:12.000Z	Comment	tde8pD6197I	"Robin Wright on ""House of Cards"" Season 6 Without Kevin Spacey | E!

Maaan at the end of S I was really looking forward to Claire showing em how it s done She had been PERFECT throughout The Entire Show always able to keep her cool and stay classy independent and empowering at the same time It was painful to watch her put up with his temper tantrums acting like a spoiled baby in S He was turning into a Stalin like paranoid o and Needed to GOOOO She was there ready to replace him and America would be saved Alas S was a complete let down an EMBARRASSMENT and exercise in misogyny and gynophobia Despite the many opportunities to take the show TO THE NEXT LEVEL the writers instead made it into a soap opera dragging us back decades in how we see women Has Disney not vilified powerful women enough I said powerful not seductive If she is not in the kitchen she must be the devil spawn Well of course everyone hates her she is Frank Underwood s wife So prove the world wrong Claire commands respect like no one else on the show Her husband commanded fear and mostly disgust towards the end but she is a mystery a beacon of patience and persistence She was a blank slate and this is what they did with her character A more evil conniving version of FU Then pardon me why all the innuendos about how she won t be like him For tragedy Oh look she thought she could be better but power ruins all Not necessarily There have been some pretty great rulers in history and I was really hoping to see a great ruler at the end of the show replacing tired old Frankey solely devoted to staying in power We see this shit on the news enough Gimme HOPE P S This is obviously Tom s baby she s carrying Does this not matter at all Is it implied Or am I Really supposed to believe it s Frank s Because I can t do that just can t I also hate that they made her preggos P P S Definitely never wanna see Mark shirtless again Definitely	UgwDtBo6mondqIuUIjx4AaABAg	2018-12-03T04:03:11.000Z	Comment	_1x2oQTjPts	House of Cards | Season 6 Review

I thought that the season was interesting Everything said in this video is definitely valid However at episode I stopped thinking that the writers were trying to erase Frank or show that Claire is better or whatever instead I saw this season as being an examination at the consequences of Frank s actions I thought that Claire being near satanic in her level of brutality was the show underlying the biggest consequence of Frank s actions She was never meant to be President I m not saying that as a jab at the show I believe that the show was trying to make this exact point Claire s inability to be a leader her inability to command that respect I believe was intentional It made us like the people who were supposed to be the antagonists but they aren t perfect people either We re left with an evil on one side and a less evil on the other which I would argue has always been the viewpoint of the show I thought it was interesting to see all the characters who had been affected by Frank s rise to power deal with his sudden death	UgxUYFLFh4CWHeiVEFZ4AaABAg	2018-12-06T23:44:05.000Z	Comment	TWNukM92y1o	House of Cards Season 6 RANT not REVIEW

You don t get that she is using feminism as a weapon It is a different more critical comment on feminism than you think In House of Cards every moral ideology loyalty social justice is used dirty But I would agree we don t need season To end with season could have been an option And I still have no real opinion about the meta moments when every thing they say about Frank is also a statement about Spacey	UgyXzPo379OF9pNue7h4AaABAg	2018-12-04T11:02:36.000Z	Comment	TWNukM92y1o	House of Cards Season 6 RANT not REVIEW
While I agree with every sentiment expressed in this video I personally thought that the show was going downhill regardless Season was a ridiculous season of a show that had lost the charm it had in early seasons and I think that an alternative season in a world where the Spacey allegations did not come out would not have been much better You put too much of the blame on the character of Claire when in fact the blame comes solely from the writing which had been on a downward spiral anyway	Ugynz0FN9sD0WkwnYzl4AaABAg	2018-12-03T17:12:35.000Z	Comment	TWNukM92y1o	House of Cards Season 6 RANT not REVIEW

crazy deranged feminists wrote this awful mess for season They took a decent actress from Forest Gump and resurrected a feminist uninteresting sociopath and thought they could make the main character as interesting as Frank Underwood Robin your talent is still dead and a distant memory in a small Alabama town called Greenbow Ironic that a white male was responsible for this shows success too Season suffered from a lethal PC injection of SJW feminism and died a slow boring painful death in episodes And maybe that was the entire idea by the writers	Ugx9QF3Pdh9TB2uYD6l4AaABAg	2018-11-30T16:37:21.000Z	Comment	TWNukM92y1o	House of Cards Season 6 RANT not REVIEW
A total waste of Wright s talent Squandered on an anti white male feminist social justice warrior s world elevated to the presidency This story line reads more like a SJW s Utopian world Wright does her best even when speaking to us the audience scenes but I found little interest in what she was saying and how anticlimactic in the way she said it Spacey made you hate him with his sense of humor Robin has none of this None of the cast were very inspiring or interesting to watch Frank Underwood made these people interesting Without him they became soap opera stand ins with desperate acting looking for a plot Nut grabber or not Kevin s acting skills made this show none of the other cast came close	UgzQGqOCm0jIZnwIt3t4AaABAg	2018-11-30T16:08:56.000Z	Comment	TWNukM92y1o	House of Cards Season 6 RANT not REVIEW
Ive struggled through episode and just not sure I can keep going House of Cards by its title has always been interesting because the plot ran on Francis precise and deliberate planning but there is always tension because one error or misjudgment could bring Underwood down In this season the house of cards falls off screen Francis who was a big but fragile man aka a house of cards Claire isn t any of that Claire is unflinching indestructible super woman with a touch of Terminator and no emotion I just dont get the same house of cards feeling watching Claire act like this	UgyfmNxs07oXH0NQ5s94AaABAg	2018-11-30T12:49:17.000Z	Comment	TWNukM92y1o	House of Cards Season 6 RANT not REVIEW

what was the point of even making that video as if NOBODY said that oh there is no point watching the show now spacey is gone before No really Everybody has already said that It s safe to assume people who did decide to watch the show knew that in season there would be no Frank and they were curious to see how Claire can do it The problem is not the character of Claire She COULD have carried the show We ve seen her growth through the seasons we saw that she used to be milder and had principles but grew stronger and more ruthless she had a great character ark It would have been interesting how she would handle same kinds of problems How she would manoeuvre and manipulate her way in the big politics The problem with the show is the ridiculous ridicuolous ridiculous in its ridiculousness story First of all the story is all over the place And secondly it s just silly It was such a tonal change I mean previous seasons had that from time to time But now I actually kinda enjoyed this season because it was so bad it s good kinda thing	UgxxLzm4MPBr7UQKmtt4AaABAg	2018-11-29T06:51:53.000Z	Comment	TWNukM92y1o	House of Cards Season 6 RANT not REVIEW

I think you were way too nice to this season in your review They introduced like different plot lines and multiple new characters and they went NOWHERE Most of the episodes were pointless in the long run Most of the episodes had no meaning That s terrible writing The finale is one of the worst finales ever It would have been somewhat tolerable if they had like more episodes after it to tie up ANY of the plot lines introduced in this season besides the mystery of Frank s death but they didn t They also tried to introduce a pro feminism anti feminism message that tried to have its cake and eat it too when they should have just kept the entire issue out of the show since that too went nowhere Terrible season that has tarnished the show IMO Terrible terrible terrible	UgxWj4TpckiUO-RPBad4AaABAg	2018-11-20T06:11:46.000Z	Comment	sjzzpS15JIk	House of Cards Season 6 Netflix Review
This was horrible and it should have ended last year However the only good thing I can say about the final episode which I haven t heard a reviewer has said about the show is the final line Claire says She says the same line about pain that Frank said in the first few minutes of the first episode of the show When he is dealing with the dog that got hit by the car and breaking the fourth wall to us he then snaps its neck and you hear him say there no more pain Maybe she meant it also for us after that snooze of a season	Ugyv4T17YcZi7_qS2Cp4AaABAg	2018-11-20T00:47:41.000Z	Comment	sjzzpS15JIk	House of Cards Season 6 Netflix Review

Amirah Kukan no I don t think he s been charged yet The thing is with cases like that is that they happened so long ago there s very little physical evidence that still exists that can be used in court But so many people came forward and confirmed it and Spacey didn t exactly help himself either by pretty much admitting it and then coming out as a way to kind of deflect any responsibility from it I think it just really riled people up and then all the allegations came out and made it pretty impossible to defend himself in the public eye	UgzNO5sOJIAvTV0cRCh4AaABAg.8nRKfTPo5Ut8nRaW7vkqoJ	2018-11-09T18:45:37.000Z	Reply	WlqZZpYqFqE	House Of Cards: Original Ending Explained

Wow I thought this was the ending season I watched all episodes and thought the were still RELEASING EPISODES BECAUSE THE OTHER SEASONS ALL HAD episode I was excited to see how this would end and didn t even know that Doug dying WAS the end until I saw this Honestly sad This is proof of how story telling is dying People always stretch out their story as long as they can with the exception of some shows like Breaking Bad I was hoping for an ending scene with Claire dead in the White House with some great cinematic scene It s also sad because season was actually pretty good a lot better then I was expecting since Kevin frank underwood wouldn t be in it If anything this season passed other seasons in the story telling ability I loved seeing Doug so much and he turned into my favorite character This season still would be good if it had a proper ending seasons for this show also did seem appropriate not too stretched out Really wish they gave us a better ending Just my opinion	UgwVhc7ZOYz9SoeZXdF4AaABAg	2018-11-29T21:00:30.000Z	Comment	XKvOcQV6E5c	RECAP!!! - House of Cards: Season 6

The books by Michael Dobbs is even better all of the background is explained and the reader is completely informed of the thoughts and plans from FU Also unlike the film FU decides to bring down the PM on his own he doesn t tell his wife until he s already started Dobbs also successfully masters the political climate in not only the party and the opposition but in the press The novel is read as the reader can fully see and understand the interconnected web of politics the press and power It s one of if not the best political novel ever written	UgzNc4bsgeozzqnB2Tp4AaABAg	2018-07-15T08:03:17.000Z	Comment	5VB_JMvcVfs	House of cards S01E01

But that s the whole point Underwood in his universe is neither likable nor charming Everyone around him mostly hates him and know how dangerous he is Even the people in HoC Universe don t like Underwood Following his rise to power and while being interviewed it is said that Underwood s popularity is extremely low Besides the UK version is not known enough me myself I discovered that a British version exists only a year ago that s why Underwood is more appealing to audiences around the world	UgyXI8k5X3S6m7jaDI94AaABAg.8fhKwM1Y4XB8mBinNQnyWV	2018-10-09T18:18:46.000Z	Reply	5VB_JMvcVfs	House of cards S01E01
Emperor Palpatine Perhaps it differs in our languages but in my it often means highly likable charming convincing and don t get me wrong bot charachters are but Underwood is more likable in reasons i stated before more charming aswell but in convincing i need to give it to Urquarth because he does it more unviolently Yes we cannot value it objectivly but trust me more people outside UK find Underwood more apealing	UgyXI8k5X3S6m7jaDI94AaABAg.8fhKwM1Y4XB8mBhAhLMnUw	2018-10-09T18:04:37.000Z	Reply	5VB_JMvcVfs	House of cards S01E01
Your whole argument can be brought down by just a few words I am Greek And perhaps you do not seem to know what charisma actually is What you describe in Frank Underwood s character is mostly passion rather than charisma While passion is just part of charisma it s not the whole thing Francis Urquhart is by far more charismatic than Underwood but perhaps less passionate but this is the classic calm and aristocratic British way which to me and many other people is the grandeur of his charm Anyway the matter is a bit subjective but the use of proper adjectives is not	UgyXI8k5X3S6m7jaDI94AaABAg.8fhKwM1Y4XB8mBg-yv1C15	2018-10-09T17:54:25.000Z	Reply	5VB_JMvcVfs	House of cards S01E01
Emperor Palpatine Look at the first season of American HoC and look at the first season of british the difference is obvious To non british viewers Urquarth is dull boring and often now sorry for this i will probably misspell non enthusiastic while on the other hand Underwood is charming full of action and he is quite trustworthy But i believe also that Spacey brought the best and he is the main reason for me why is Underwood so charismatic And what i also enjoyed more in American version is Underwoods dynamic with other charachters and how sometimes he trough sheer threat gets what he wants	UgyXI8k5X3S6m7jaDI94AaABAg.8fhKwM1Y4XB8mBelUFXjtp	2018-10-09T17:43:34.000Z	Reply	5VB_JMvcVfs	House of cards S01E01

It s kinda prophetic and poetic albeit unintentionally that Kevin Spacey suffered precisely the downfall that a major character in season of house of cards an enemy of Underwood s suffered The problem wasn t guilty until proven innocent regarding whatever Spacey did or didn t do in and and etc People involved in the show itself claimed that he made them feel unsafe and made it a toxic environment Once that came out of course they had to kick him out Too bad I would have loved to see his ultimate downfall onscreen	UgxMgN3aQob4MBoFezF4AaABAg	2018-11-03T04:50:21.000Z	Comment	Cy_Kws0wdX4	"HOUSE OF CARDS Season 6 ""Death of Frank Underwood"" Trailer (NEW 2018) Netflix Series HD"

The cinematography is amazing Like something out of a Christopher Nolan film The writing is Shakespearean fast and witty and darkly poetic The acting is flawless as if the characters are completely unaware of a camera in the room save for the fact that Kevin Spacey breaks the fourth wall to give us insight into his menacing thoughts The plot is about a politician who will stop at nothing to climb the political ladder and get to the top It s a madman trying to take over the world concept Frank Underwood Kevin Spacey and his wife are ruthless Darwinists who are master manipulators and won t hesitate to orchestrate homicide just to become President and First Lady of the U S	Ugi_Sza13vCQfXgCoAEC	2015-07-04T08:00:06.000Z	Comment	SseGZNMujXs	HOUSE OF CARDS | TRAILER | Netflix Original Series | HD

Even though it s been revealed that the actor Kevin Spacey was a scumbag criminal of the worst kind I still think the show runners for the sake of the story should have written out Frank Underwood We watch this show for the two halfs of this robotic team They should have just re casted the role of Frank Underwood If the actors convinces us of the illusion they are selling then they did their job rightfully I never feel that it s always meant for just one person	UgzmVt9bYNGrKlUIaix4AaABAg	2018-08-17T16:53:20.000Z	Comment	dNAFTJ_Blg8	House of Cards Explained: Shakespeare, History & Guilty Pleasure

You could tell with Donald Trump s face yesterday during the funeral of George HW Bush RIP that he looks worried and I bet you that he would be thinking about himself in a box that they would hardly be anybody there and what good words could people stand up and say about him and you can also tell that his wife is having to pretend everything is okay if I was to have a guess she s been paid millions to act as a wife but technically she does not let him go anywhere near her A intimate status do you think the lady that you pulled out do you think she could do a final blow on him his wife the first lady do you think that she possibly could put a final blow in his downfall because we know stormy Daniels was paid we know that for a fact we know the Russians have sex tape on Donald Trump so his wife could not be a happy bunny I know I wouldn t me money goes along way if you know that he s not going to last as the American president she would want too sercue A stable and financial future and children just a thought I was pondering with let me know what you think his because I believe she will and as for Ivanka and Jon trump they are big boys and girls they know what rules are and if you put your hand in the fire you will get burnt they knew what they were doing so if they are crying now all I would say save your tears for your pillow	UgyXh3wb-6u0a4UyRIF4AaABAg	2018-12-06T09:43:07.000Z	Comment	nkgSKL5lrMg	Ivanka’s house of cards...

Wow this was way worse than I thought it would be Nothing good about it really just beyond silly with insane amount of over the top feminism Which that is in just about everything now but maybe this season was the crowning jewel for the I woman I perfect crowd Extremely boring and waste of time watching it Without Kevin Spacey the show collapsed completely but it hadn t been very good in the last few years But was way better than the mess they put up this year Netflix should be embarrassed but I m sure they are not It was after all just about women mostly even though they tried to hide some of it behind her being such a terrible person	UgxU3bKMxt8iZoR3qUJ4AaABAg	2018-11-11T03:58:22.000Z	Comment	yCIopZbsVK4	"HOUSE OF CARDS Season 6 ""Claire Underwood Attempted Murder"" Trailer (NEW 2018) Netflix Series HD"

Toda la temporada pense que en algun momento se miraria de espaldas a un hombre en traje sin decir nombres sin mostrarse pero todo dejando claro que era frank maquinando las cosas tras bambalinas y que hubiera cerrado con un doble golpe a una mesa jaja pero ya hablando sobre la serie la verdad es que se nota que no estaba hecha asi y se tuvo que rehacer para adaptarla a una temporada sin kevin y la verdad se resiente no me gusto nada no me daban ganas de ver otro algo aburrida y si ese final es para hacer un spinoff con clare la verdad se lo pueden ahorrar	Ugy4wG9zYssu5ceF-N14AaABAg	2018-12-06T02:58:56.000Z	Comment	uO_5pF7BtEc	Explicación del Final de House of Cards (Temporada Final)

Recien termino de ver la temporada y tengo una teoria no tan errada Primero pienso que la hija a nacer pertenece a Tom Yates razon de desvinculacion total por eso lo mata Frank nunca tuvo intenciones de ser padre ni vivo ni muerto Segundo quedan muchos hilos sueltos por un lado los Sheperd que quieren introducir su propio partido politico la reportera con los datos de la tumba de Rachel en el departamento de Doug Duncan el hijo de Anette preso y no sabemos que pasa y la frutilla del postre la hija de Claire Un final decepcionante pero me parece lo mejor que pudieron hacer luego del quilombo con Spacey Sin dudar EL era la ESTRELLA del show	UgzSBawLZAFHU2sJyhB4AaABAg	2018-11-24T07:24:07.000Z	Comment	uO_5pF7BtEc	Explicación del Final de House of Cards (Temporada Final)

Yo creo que el error de los guionista fue darle carpetazo a los cr menes de Francis Underwood pudieron haber hecho una trama interesante poniendo a Claire a salvar su mandato deshaciendose de las maldades de Francis y peleando contra rivales pol ticos que se vieron en temporadas anteriores y contra los periodistas que los investigaban y aun asi salur victoriosa esa trama suena m s coherente No me gust que se sacar n personajes de la manga se sinti forzado La direcci n fall con una Claire muy inexoresiva hasta el cap tulo remonta un poco la historia y se siente el ritmo como en otras temporadas Me gust el final pero no me encant	UgzYFVVcjtHj_KXFjXp4AaABAg	2018-11-19T17:50:05.000Z	Comment	uO_5pF7BtEc	Explicación del Final de House of Cards (Temporada Final)
