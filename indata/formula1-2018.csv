Ocon should learn that it is simply not done to unlap yourself And if you do the leader should not IN ANY WAY be hindered by it That is the unwritten rule Max did not expect Ocon NOT to back off I think Ocon did his chances of returning to F no good at all today Max has gained a lot of respect by wheeling in Hamilton with a damaged chassis	2018-11-12T08:05:32.000Z	Comment	nr22p74iZG4	Formula one 2018 Brazil Grand Prix race Highlights

Ocon ignored the blue flags and should have backed off when it comes to the race leader he had absolutely nothing to gain by his action since he wasn t even fighting for points at that stage Max was in the middle of a race with Hamilton so he wanted to get past as fast as possible and Ocon deliberately hindered him Max s only mistake was that he didn t anticipate that a backmarker wouldn t let him through so he should have been more careful	2018-11-17T09:10:43.000Z	Comment	nr22p74iZG4	Formula one 2018 Brazil Grand Prix race Highlights

Fang Lei yeah some kind of ground effect should be introduced so there is no need to have such complex aero and so dirty air and still have a lot of grip with aero ground effect and because of this DRS isn t needed then racing would be awesome Also refueling should be introduced again so they can go flat out as in V era Actually im against DRS isnt it active aero Btw i have to say some of cars are also from tje most beautiful as the w and w and the str i like mcl too	2018-10-14T00:26:18.000Z	Reply	u4Ttzw7a5OE	Singapore Grand Prix Qualifying Highlights
Yes the cars are one of the fastest in the history of F even though many people thought that f cars were the fastest but these cars can be times or even more faster with so much down force and a lot of stuff simulated in computers so the developments can be faster and better People don t realize that once they change the front spoiler rule and many others these cars might be the fastest for this era Really wished that they can come up with something special like embracing the fan car technology which not only they can put the same down force as these or even more they can eliminate the problems the cars have like making a super sleek simple front spoiler and still have the same down force with the fan and having a system that reduces the speed of the fan to increase top speed with a button like drs or a automatic system And also people don t really embrace the concept of DRS as it is a amazing idea to be able to change the aero for more top speed so we are basically stuck with a non live adjustable aero system for Other motorsports but finally F has it and they are getting rid of it Just think of how amazing it would be if F had Active aero	2018-10-13T20:21:31.000Z	Reply	u4Ttzw7a5OE	Singapore Grand Prix Qualifying Highlights

Swapnil Nayak As opposed to a crybaby who throws a temper tantrum when his teammate outqualifies him Or the same crybaby who pulls up next to his rival and rams him behind the safety car because he claims he got brake checked despite the telemetry data showing otherwise Or the same crybaby who defies a pre race agreement with his teammate and overtakes him when both were instructed to slow down to save their tires But yep bring up Hamilton and Massa s race incidents That s clearly the same as Vettel s misdemeanours Roll eyes	2018-09-24T10:09:47.000Z	Reply	fvgWJu30r3E	How the Formula Title Race Turned

Swapnil Nayak A retired German driver complimenting his fellow compatriot Who would have figured And since when are Schumacher s words gospel This is the same guy who won a World Championship by ramming his rival into the wall got disqualified from another World Championship for ramming his rival unsuccessfully this time had numerous victories handed to him by teammates handpicked to be his backup including the infamous Austrian Grand Prix got penalised for deliberately blocking at Monaco during qualifying in etc The man may have won more titles than anyone but he was not afraid to bend the rules and in many cases break them But since you brought up Schumacher s comments let s look at comments from Fernando Alonso a man who successfully beat Schumacher to a title His opinion was that he was glad that Hamilton won the title last season as Vettel having and Hamilton having was illogical Translation Vettel is not on Hamilton s level But I m sure you ll come up with some excuse for that too And if I bring up Red Bull s dominant car you ll just point to Mercedes dominance But here s a stat that can t be disputed Even when Hamilton was in a struggling McLaren he still won multiple races for years straight from Since Vettel s fourth championship in he has had two seasons where he didn t win a single race and Interestingly enough no pole positions during those seasons The only other season that has happened was his rookie year in But wait a minute Even in the years when Hamilton had a far less competitive car rd in the Constructors Championship in and he still managed to achieve multiple poles and race wins But that can t be right Because he only wins due to a dominant Mercedes Right	2018-09-23T13:48:22.000Z	Reply	fvgWJu30r3E	How the Formula Title Race Turned

Mark Robinson Yea you wish Vettel is right up there with Prost Senna and Schumi whether you like it or not Schumi himself said it before he went into coma Vettel wants Kimi in the team because there is no bullshit between them and no politics either not because Kimi will help him in winning WDC best example is Italy where Seb had to race Kimi and could not make it The disappointment after qualifying was expected as Ferrari placed him far away from the Mercedes cars and was not able to get the tow unlike Kimi Atleast Seb is not like Hamilton where he needs Bottas to win a race if he is not in the lead	2018-09-23T11:54:53.000Z	Reply	fvgWJu30r3E	How the Formula Title Race Turned

Swapnil Nayak Vettel only wants Kimi in the team as long as he believes he will help him win the title That has clearly not been the case this season And look no further than qualifying at the Italian Grand Prix to see how Vettel reacts when his backup performs better than him As for vetoe power it relates specifically to who he will allow in the team The point being he does not want Hamilton or Verstappen to join the team as he views them as a serious threat to his position as the driver within the team And nobody said Vettel was shit I said he is the most overrated multiple time World Champion in F history He won his titles at a time when he had by far the best car Red Bull a clearly inferior teammate Webber and a garage that was doing all they could to ensure he would beat his teammate Granted Hamilton won in a dominant Mercedes but Rosberg was much better than Webber and he also had the team trying their best to make him win The season was practically Hamilton vs Rosberg and the Mercedes team Notice how all those mechanical failures that Rosberg avoided in magically ceased once Rosberg retired I believe Hamilton is right up there with Schumacher and Senna And as good as Vettel may be he is not on their level Not even close	2018-09-22T09:54:07.000Z	Reply	fvgWJu30r3E	How the Formula Title Race Turned
Mark Robinson Hamilton is beating Vettel in an inferior car Lol what sport are you watching this years Mercedes is slightly behind the Ferrari only in straight line speed otherwise they are mostly evenly matched but that was not the case for the previous years where the silvers were dominating So I suggest you to keep quiet ya Little cuck and the point about Leclerc was to say that Vettel does not have Veto in the team as he wanted Kimi to stay u dipshit Keep coming up crap reasons to justify Hamilton is great and Sebastian is shit for me both are great just that one is superb form while the other has some serious issues to deal with before he can be champion again	2018-09-22T09:19:34.000Z	Reply	fvgWJu30r3E	How the Formula Title Race Turned
My main difference between Hamilton and Vettel is even in when Hamilton crashed and let himself down with driving discipline his opponent wasn t quicker even after his clutch issues in races and DNF while a mile ahead in Malaysia his opponent was not quicker but Vettel was completely out driven by rookie Danny R that s the difference for me	2018-09-22T08:59:25.000Z	Reply	fvgWJu30r3E	How the Formula Title Race Turned

Imagine if the season s reviews of the s had used the standard we use today to judge the races Annnnd the first dull race of the season Oh another dull race Oh another dull race Oh wow an actual close race I think a lot of the same people who complain about this modern Formula in a way are the total representation of the modern Formula fan They demand tenth of a second finished each race A driver who wins in dominant form Boring it is a shame Formula is broken they shout Where is the romance the spirit in that attitude The same people decrying artificial Mario Kart racing decry every real race that isn t artificially close as boring dull a wast of time etc Some of the greatest drives in history have been total dominations by drivers who on that day in that place were in a class of its own Sure it s not a photo finish but racing is about driving and winning not artificially making things close for fans who on the one hand decry all change but on the other hand demand massive changes to change the fundamentals of F to make it more exciting F racing is massively closer today than it was back in its hey day It is less competitive in the sense that less teams can actually win but nonetheless the cars are closer together I would not want to watch a top racing series where a driver who utterly out performs his teammate and his opponents and wins by a big margin is somehow looked up as dull boring and a waste of time I don t only watch racing for the rare ultra close photo finish I also watch it for the sake of driving cars teams etc Even a dominant win is still never a gurantee My only point is that fans and the culture around F have become so intensely focused on entertainment and close racing that they miss the forest for the trees It takes all the fun out of to micro analyze everything Watch a season review and look at how many dull races there were by today s standards AND YET all of today s modern fans say things like It was so much better back then It sucks now But the at the same time anytime there is a race similar to races of the s they say boring Lol	2018-12-05T17:20:15.000Z	Comment	TD62z43fXYo	This Year in F1 2018 - Season Review

I was never glad to see DRS when it was first introduced into the sport as I feel it doesn t separate the great drivers from the good drivers enough It detracts from the raw skill of the drivers and creates an unnatural advantage which at times is just ridiculous tbh I can understand it being brought into F as it seems a bit more appealing for the casual fans because it does create a lot more overtaking making for a greater attraction for the wider audience but I guess I was spoiled by the more pure racing I enjoyed in the s and early s I just wish that it they must keep Drs in the sport that they could do something to make it less overpowered and ridiculous than what it is today In other words separate the Men from the Boys	2018-11-16T14:50:11.000Z	Comment	byStQVA-bFU	Max Gets Mad + All The Best Onboards | 2018 Brazilian Grand Prix

He s not gonna get it again Which is kinda sad since it s the first season for years that the Ferrari is really equal to the Merc But it simply happens too often that he cracks under pressure he just threw away so many points Some bad results this season were not his fault but the team s whereas Baku and France this year were just stupid driver mistakes German GP was a catastrophy which I think was the turning point in the championship His situation is not comparable with the Red Bull years in those days he had a real monster of a car but no serious competition Also he doesn t have that huge fan support anymore like Schumacher had or R ikkonen still has despite not having any chance in the WDC Those tifosi slowly turned away from Vettel since he already f ed up three seasons threw away a clear win in Germany this year and also ruined a possible victory at Monza with his stupid move on Hamilton	2018-09-13T19:31:04.000Z	Comment	nXBrctHv4Oo	How The 2018 Title Race Has Unfolded So Far

Ham just gets too much support from FIA since F is not a sport anymore it s a complete business And if you guys wanna talk about mistakes Vettel is scripted to deliver them just like Ham is scripted into getting support from the stewards when you don t see it happening during races F is too corrupt as much as FIFA is There s too much to say	2018-09-02T16:27:15.000Z	Comment	nXBrctHv4Oo	How The 2018 Title Race Has Unfolded So Far

I don t understand they want the largest audience and decide to put it on FB Hold these tournaments in the off season and actually advertise it I keep seeing these highlight reels and ask myself where is qualifying where are the full races where are the points per race not just overall driver standings etc Also why not have an actual official representative overseeing these races so they can add penalties and make calls either during or after the race to make it more fair That will finally stop Brendon from being such a dirty racer yes he s fast but constantly cutting people off and leaving no room doesn t make a decent driver It would make it more interesting when other drivers can appeal after the race A good start but a lot of work is needed to make this into an actual event to follow	2018-12-02T07:29:21.000Z	Comment	uhACaYPmmDY	F1 New Balance Esports Pro Series 2018: Grand Final Best Bits
